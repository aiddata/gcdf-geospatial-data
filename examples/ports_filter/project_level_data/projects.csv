Through this loan package, the People's Bank of China would provide $50 million via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC) and IDB Invest agreed to provide up to 664 million Brazilian reais and $38 million.  The China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean loan has a 14-year interest and a floating (LIBOR-based) interest rate. It is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a first-priority lien in all ‘Project Collateral’. The loan agreement's definition of ‘Project Collateral’ can be found in the collateral section of the loan details.  ​​The IDB approval date for this loan financing was December 12, 2017, and it refers to this project as ""Porto de Sergipe LNG-to-Power Project,"" project code 12048-01.  The project was additionally co-financed by a $200 million loan from the International Finance Corporation, as well as a bond issue for approximately $1 billion in reais at a fixed, long-term rate in international markets, 95% guaranteed by SERV, the Swiss export and import credit agency. The bond issue was coordinated by Goldman Sachs and settled through Swiss Insured Brazil Power Finance, a Luxembourg-based special purpose vehicle. General Electric provided separate financing as well  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1.5GW (1,551 MW) combined-cycle gas-fired power plant in Barra dos Coqueiros, Brazil. The project also involves the construction of a 33km-long, 500kV transmission line (connecting the high-voltage Jardin substation located in Nossa Senhora do Socorro). Lastly, the project involves the construction of a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) and associated facilities (a submarine pipeline and water intake and sewage pipes). Upon completion, the power plant is expected be the biggest thermal power plant in Brazil by capacity. Centrais Eletricas de Sergipe (CELSE) is the owner and developer of the power plant.   The Porto de Sergipe LNG-based power plant is being developed on a 511,622m² (51.16ha) site located approximately 10km away from Aracaju. The combined-cycle power plant will be equipped with three GE 7HA gas turbines, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and a steam turbine also from GE. Other infrastructure that will be part of the plant includes a cooling tower, a water treatment plant, and an onsite substation. The plant is expected to operate with an efficiency of more than 62%. Natural gas will be delivered to the plant through a pipeline from a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) to be stationed 6.5km away from the coastline. The FSRU will have 170,000m³ of LNG storage capacity and 21 million cubic meters a day (Mcmd) of regasification capacity. It will receive LNG by tankers and LNG carriers. CELSE signed an agreement with Golar Power to charter the Golar Nanook FSRU for 25 years for the power plant in October 2016.   The electricity generated by the Porto de Sergipe power plant will be sent to the National Interconnect System (SIN) through the 33km-long, 500kV transmission line connecting the high-voltage Jardin substation located in Nossa Senhora do Socorro. The electricity generated by the plant will be sold to 26 different customers under multiple long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) executed through an auction by the Brazilian government in April 2015. Further, it operates as a backup base load power plant and is expected to dispatch to the national grid between 30‐50% of the time, as required by the Electric System National Operator (ONS).  General Electric was awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the Porto de Sergipe power plant in October 2016. The scope of the contract includes supply and installation of three 7HA gas turbines, a steam turbine, a HRSG, as well as the 33km transmission line and the substation. GE also entered a contractual service agreement (CSA) and a long-term operations and maintenance (O&M) agreement for the majority of the project in October 2016. Sapura Energy was awarded the EPC contract for the gas pipeline portion of the Porto de Sergipe power project in November 2017. It is also responsible for the transportation and installation of the FSRU mooring system as well as for the FSRU hook-up. Golar LNG was contracted as the O&M operator for the FRSU. Black & Veatch was appointed as the owner’s engineer for the Porto de Sergipe power plant in November 2016.   Construction started following the final investment decision (FID) in October 2016. The power plant was originally scheduled to come online in January 2020. The project ultimately reached its commercial operations date (COD) in March 2020.","1.

This loan consists of USD 50 million from the China Co-financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC), USD 147 million loan from the IDB itself, and the mobilization of USD 180 million in resources from other investors, including KfW DEG, a German financial institution and subsidiary of KfW; and Proparco, a French development finance institution. The IDB Invest portion had a 15 year maturity period, though the CHC loan borrowing terms are unknown.  The IDB approval date for this loan financing was May 1, 2018, and it refers to this project with code 12177-01 and name ""Posorja Port.""   The total investment of the first phase was estimated at USD 538 million as of April 26, 2019. The total cost of the project is expected to be USD 1.2 billion USD. The Guayaquil Port Authority (APG) helped with implementation of the project, and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was one of the major project contractors.   This deepwater port is a public private partnership (PPP) project, for which DP World Posorja received a 50 year concessionaire contract in May 2016. The port is located on the Guayas River, about 65 km from Guayaquil, and is expected to have a 750,000 TEU annual capacity.  Construction for Phase I of the project began in July 2017. The port began operations in August 2019, though the final part of the first phase was finished in May 2020 with the arrival of four additional cranes. This first phase included, among other things, the creation of a 20 km service road to allow access to and from the port; the development of a multi-purpose terminal with 4 Quay Cranes, 15 rubber tyred gantry (RTGs), and a 400-meter pier; and the dredging of a deepwater access channel, 33.8 kilometers long (21 nautical miles), 16.5 meters deep, and 175 meters wide.   This is the first deepwater port in Ecuador, intended to allow Post Panamax type vessels to maximize their cargo capacity. The port will additionally serve Neo Panamax and Triple E Class ships. The project's second phase is expected to consist of the development of a Special Economic Zone adjacent to the port, including a 1 square km logistics and industrial park.  The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

54912,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Antigua and Barbuda,ATG,America,2016,2018.0,,China Eximbank provides RMB 600 million government concessional loan for Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project,"On December 21, 2007, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. On November 18, 2013, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on November 11, 2014, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda submitted a project proposal and application for a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Antigua. On December 22, 2014, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed an RMB 1,590,000,000 commercial (‘design and construction’) contract (#AB/PMP-01) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on May 25, 2015, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed a revised commercial contract (#AB/PMP-02) worth RMB 585,000,000. Then, on November 25, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Less than a month later, on December 15, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a framework agreement for a RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 21.75 years. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 19, 2038. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance the RMB 585,000,000 commercial contract that was signed on May 25, 2015. The remaining RMB 15,000,000 was to be used by the borrower to finance a contract with Guangxi Bagui Project Supervision and Consultant Co. Ltd for project management and supervision activities related to the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The borrower also agreed to deposit the operating income generated by the project in an escrow account to support debt service requirements.   The purpose of the project is to bring about the long-awaited transformation of the St. John’s Port from a break-bulk facility to a modern container port facility that is capable of increasing annual cargo throughput from 16,000 containers to 80,000 containers. It involves the construction of a new Customs and Port Authority headquarters, the expansion of a quay (extension of the existing pier), the construction of a new warehouse for processing goods, the extension of a sea wall, the dredging of the harbor, and the establishment of a logistics park. Some of the expected project benefits include improved ship-to-shore interface; greater efficiency in the clearance of goods; automated scanning and computerized handling/clearance of goods; reduced ground transportation costs, and greater ease of doing business.   CCECC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 15, 2018. However, the project did not commence until September 8, 2018. It was originally envisaged that the project would take three years to implement.  Satellite imagery suggests that, as of July 2020, a 320-meter quay expansion and the construction of a new warehouse were complete (or nearly completed).  Satellite imagery from July 2020 also suggests that, on the northern side of the port, land had been built up for what is likely the new sea wall and a set of buildings and a parking lot had been constructed, while another pier to the south was being added to the existing cruise terminal. The construction of the container terminal was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on October 13, 2020. St. John’s Port has reportedly become the only port with professional container transshipment terminal and automated cross-transshipment capacity in eastern Caribbean region, thus helping Antigua and Barbuda in building itself into a regional logistics center and promoting the country’s economic and social development.","1.

85355,Yes,8,No,China (People's Republic of),Mexico,MEX,America,2015,,,[China Co-Financing Fund] IDB administers 25 million USD loan from CHC to Contecon Manzanillo for Container Port and Logistics Facility,"On 21 October 2015, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed a loan contract with Contecon Manzanillo to finance a Container Port and Logistics Facility, through which the IDB would provide 65 million USD from its ordinary capital (Loan 3348A/OC-ME-1, Loan 3348A/OC-ME-2), and the People's Bank of China would provide 25 million USD (Loan 3348/CH-ME-1, Loan 3348/CH-ME-2) via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC). The IDB would also administer a B loan, which would be financed by other commercial banks or financial institutions (Loan 3348B/OC-ME).  The IDB approval date for this loan financing was 19 November 2014,  and it refers to this project as ""ME-L1152 : Contecon Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility"".  This project would involve the expansion of the pre-existing Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility, located in the State of Colima, Mexico. The loan financing went to the development of infrastructure to help increase the port's capacity by 1.35 million TEU annually by 2021. It is also intended to directly contribute to the Government of Mexico’s Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2013-2018.  The specific portions of the container port and logistics facility that the China Co-Financing Fund and IDB ordinary capital loans went towards were yard development, additional ship-to-shore cranes and all related yard equipment, ground slots, intermodal facilities, other related infrastructure, and all indirect costs related to the financing itself (Project Overview). The IDB also offered the project technical support.   The loan recipient, Contecton Manzanillo, is a special purpose vehicle created for the purpose of creating the container port and logistics facility and is a subsidiary of  International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI). ICTSI is a private port management and development company headquartered in the Philippines and was awarded a 34 year concession contract for the development and operation of the Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility by the Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transporte, SCT), through the Manzanillo Port Administration (Administración Portuaria Integral de Manzanillo S.A. de C.V.) in January 2010.  Terminal construction for the original Container Port and Logistics Facility, which was expanded upon by this project, began in December 2010, and on August 5, 2013, the first vehicle was received for operation (per the Contecon Manzanillo website). Construction was 90 percent complete and the project was operating at a 10 percent capacity in October 2013, per the Environmental and Social Management Report (ESMR) from the IDB. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) was the primary contractor on the initial construction of the Container Port and Logistics Facility, but it is unclear if they were involved in the parts of the project funded by the China Co-Financing Fund and other IDB loan. In October 2019, two gantry cranes and five rubber tire gantries (RTG) were delivered to the port, likely funded through this project.  In addition to the IDB ordinary capital loan, other co-financiers for the program included the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which loaned 65 million USD; the German development bank KfW, which loaned 52.5 million USD; and Standard Chartered Bank. The total project cost was estimated to be about 567 million USD, as of October 2015.  The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

43110,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Cuba,CUB,America,2014,2015.0,2018.0,China Eximbank provides $120 million loan for Port of Santiago Modernization Project,"On July 22, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Cuba signed a $120 million loan agreement for the Port of Santiago Modernization Project.  The Port of Santiago is the second largest port in Cuba and is 900 kilometers east of the capital, Havana. Prior to project implementation, the port could only accommodate 20,000 ton ships, but its modernization with support from China Eximbank would reportedly allow 40,000 ton cargo ships to enter and exit.  The multipurpose port was meant have a length of 231.15 meters. The annual throughput of the terminal would reportedly be increased to 565,000 tons.  The project also included social infrastructure, a bifurcated railway branch for the transfer of loads, and state-of-the-art cargo equipment.  China Communications Construction Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation .  Construction began in January 2015 with the expansion of the multipurpose maritime terminal, Puerto Guillermón Moncada.  An on-site construction inspection was conducted on January 9, 2018 by Hong Xiao, the Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Cuba, and his team.

(CHEC) provided a $5.1 million supplier's credit (loan) to the Government of Grenada. The House of Representatives of Grenada approved the 2013 Budget Loan Authorisation Act, 2013, which included the loan, on April 18, 2013. The Senate of Grenada approved the authorization on April 24, 2013. The act received the assent of the Governor-General of Grenada on May 2, 2013, but the interest rate, terms and repayment, and fees were all to be negotiated at a later date. The supplier's credit loan was intended to finance a commercial contract between CHEC and the Government of Grenada signed on April 12, 2013 for the St. Mark's Flood Mitigation Project. The entire project cost EC$13 million.  The purpose of this project was to protect the town of Victoria from flooding via involved the construction of flood mitigation structures, watercourse dredging, and the reconstruction and enhancement of slope protection along St. Mark's River. It also included addition of new signs for swimming areas as well as repairs to the waterfront and road subgrade. The project specifically sought to construct gabion bank protection walls over an area of 900 meters along the banks of the river. The walls were to stretch from the sea to the Bonair Government School.    St. Mark's River is located in Saint Mark Parish, where flooding during the rainy season had caused house collapses and deaths. The project sought to protect residents and properties from the flooding risk, and allow the area to become a place of tourism and leisure for the parish.  CHEC was the contractor for project implementation, while Grenada's Ministry of Works was the Grenadian government agency responsible for certifying the project. CHEC used a large section of the grounds of the Bonair Government School as a project site; it also donated school supplies to students at the school (as captured via Project ID#85814) and donated a basketball court (as captured via Project ID#85813) during the implementation of the flood mitigation project.  The project's groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 29, 2013 and was attended by Prime Minister of Grenada Keith Mitchell. The construction period was originally expected to last 12 months. The project was ultimately completed on June 27, 2014 in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Mitchell. The ceremony was held on the newly-built basketball court donated by CHEC the same day.  There are some indications that the loan for the St. Mark's Flood Mitigation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2013, the Government of Grenada defaulted on its foreign and local currency debt maturing in 2025, ceasing service on $193 million external debt and EC$184 million in local currency debt.",1.

39740,Yes,1098,No,China (People's Republic of),Bahamas,BHS,America,2012,2014.0,2018.0,China Eximbank provides RMB 257.2 million loan for the North Abaco Port & Little Abaco Bridge Project (Linked to Project ID#39640),"In February 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of the Bahamas signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 260 million for the North Abaco Port & Little Abaco Bridge Project. The face value of the loan was later revised to RMB 257.2 million. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The loan’s final maturity date is September 2032. This loan supported two subsidiary projects: the construction of North Abaco Port (estimated cost: $33.4 million) and the construction of Little Abaco Bridge Project (estimated cost: $6.5 million). The first loan disbursement took place in August 2013. The total amount outstanding under the loan agreements that the Government of Bahamas and China Eximbank have signed (as captured via Project ID#39719 and Project ID#39740) is $46.1 million as of December 31, 2012, $67.1 million as of December 31, 2013, $70.7 million as of December 31, 2014, $72.4 million as of December 31, 2015, $80.8 million as of December 31, 2016, $82.8 million as of June 30, 2017, $65.2 million as of September 30, 2021, $62.9 million as of March 31, 2022, and $53.1 million as of September 30, 2022.  The construction of North Abaco Port — located at Conch Rock Creek, two miles north of Coopers Town in North Abaco — was intended to provide an alternative to existing facilities in Marsh Harbour and also facilitate proposed developments in Abaco and on the cays north of Treasure Cay. The construction of Little Abaco Bridge (locational coordinates: 26.9020°, -77.5802° WGS84) was designed to have an opening of 150 feet to allow water flow and restore tidal flow between the two islands — Little Abaco and Great Abaco — to revive and permit fish migrations and allow small pleasure crafts as well as small fishing vessels to go between the north and sides of Abaco without having to go the long way around by sea. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation.  Construction was originally scheduled to start in September 2013, but it ultimately started on June 25, 2014. The delay was the result of environmental concerns that were raised about the project. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion by 2016. However, it was ultimately completed on May 31, 2018.","1. The Bahamas was not an ODA-eligible recipient in 2012. As such, the flow class field is set to OOF-Like.2. This is one of the projects in a $41 million package from China Eximbank (see Project ID#39640). 3. Several official sources (e.g. https://www.bahamasbudget.gov.bs/media/filer_public/05/4e/054e4a5e-1633-47cb-8c6c-705c164e74df/mof-pdsb-3rdquarter-may2022-final-digital.pdf) refer to three loans from China Eximbank with outstanding amounts, which suggests that two separate loans may have been issued for the construction of North Abaco Port and the construction of Little Abaco Bridge Project. This issue warrants further investigation.

On 20 October 2009, Uruguay's National Ports Administration (Administración Nacional de Puertos) signed a contract with the Chinese company Nuctech Company Limited for the implementation of this project. The scanner was delivered on 23 August 2010. It was estimated that the new equipment would start operating in the first months of 2011. Under the agreement, China offers the services of an official from China, who will supervise for the proper functioning of the equipment for one year.  The scanner had a value of 66,087,053 Uruguayan pesos according to the 2011 financial statement from Uruguay's National Ports Administration, or close to 1.5 million USD according to an article from the Presidency of Uruguay. According to the same Uruguayan government source that cites the 1.5 million USD value of the scanner, the agreement signed with China also included funding for the maintenance and training costs of six people for the management of the scanner. Therefore, the original 20 million CNY amount from the agreement has been coded as the transaction amount. The six individuals who received training included three customs officials, one prefecture official, one Faculty of Engineering official, and one Port official.  This donation stems from the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement that was signed on 12 May 2008 and approved by Law 18,470 of Uruguay on 17 March 2009.

The purpose of the project was to acquire and install mobile container inspection equipment (un equipo móvil de inspección de contenedores), in Guayaquil Port, to be used by the Guayaquil Port Authority.   It was funded through the 20 million RMB grant provided in an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) signed November 17, 2005.  The equipment was to be manufactured by the Chinese company NUCTECH Company Limited. Additionally, in the Letters of Exchange, the Chinese government agreed to send a team of technicians to Ecuador to help with installation, recalibration, and training associated with the project.  The Chinese government began transporting the equipment on October 15, 2006. The equipment was officially handed over on December 11, 2006 in Guayaquil.  The project is also referred to as ""Equipos de rayos x para contenedores"" in Spanish. The Chinese project title is 厄瓜多尔一台移动式集装箱检测设备项目.","The ETCA that funded this project, signed November 17, 2005, has not been coded as a separate umbrella project, due to the entire grant amount provided very likely funding this project exclusively. It has been assumed that the project cost is 20 million RMB. According to 'La Cooperación Bilateral Ecuador-China...', the project cost was 2,537,468.50 USD. An exchange rate between USD and RMB of approximately 1:7.8818 would result in this project cost being equivalent to 20 million RMB, which would have been the exchange rate on either October 27 or 30, 2006 (per https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-CNY-2006). It has therefore been assumed that the full grant provided in November 2005 was used for the project due to (1) the extreme closeness in these two transaction amounts, accounting for the exchange rate around the time of project implementation, and (2) the fact that other projects listed the tables seem to have their amounts reflect the values of the projects at the time they were implemented, not when the table was complied (see, for example, project 'Medicamentos para prevención del dengue' which was said to be worth 500,000 USD in the table and in the Letters of Exchange from 2005). 'La Cooperación Bilateral Ecuador-China...' is an academic source that cites, for this transaction amount, a now-inaccessible Ecuador government website.
