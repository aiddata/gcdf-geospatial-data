# Visualizing geospatial features using QGIS

This example utilizes the free and open source geographic information system software [QGIS](https://qgis.org/). If you wish to explore the data and visualizations using QGIS, please visit their site to download and install the software. Once installed, you will also need the easy-to-install "QuickMapServices" plugin ([see this tutorial](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_plugins/plugin_examples.html)).

With QGIS and the QuickMapServices plugin installed, download the contents of the `examples/laos_maps` folder from this repository. You can simply download a zipfile of the entire repository using [this link](https://github.com/aiddata/china-osm-geodata/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) as well (please note that the full repository is fairly large, approximately 270MB when zipped). Once downloaded, navigate to and open the `laos_viz.qgz` file. This file should automatically load in QGIS.

You can explore the geospatial features within QGIS, or navigate to the `Project > Layouts` menu to open one of two pre-built visualizations. The "country" visualization looks at projects across the country of Laos, while the "satellite" visualization zooms in to see the detail of individual features within the capital.
