96203,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2021,,,BNM makes RMB 6.55 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2021 (Linked to Project ID#96202),"On February 8, 2009, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) — Malaysia’s central bank — and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 80 billion (MYR 40 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Malaysia. On February 8, 2012, BNM and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement and increased the maximum drawing rights from RMB 80 billion (MYR 40 billion) to RMB 180 billion (MYR 90 billion). BNM and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement — with maximum drawing rights of RMB 180 billion (MYR 90 billion) — again on April 17, 2015, August 20, 2018, and April 17, 2020. BNM made two (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement in 2020 and 2021: an RMB 7,169,923,934 (MYR 4,294,000,000) drawdown in 2020 and an RMB 6,558,437,637 (MYR 4,416,000,000) drawdown in 2021. The interest rate that applied to these borrowings is unknown. However, it is known that the maturity of each borrowing was approximately 1 year (12 months). It is also known that the amount outstanding under the PBOC swap line was RMB 7,169,923,934 (MYR 4,294,000,000) as of December 31, 2020 and RMB 6,558,437,637 (MYR 4,416,000,000) as of December 31, 2021.The 2020 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96202 and the 2021 drawdown is captured here.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawdowns are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 4. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending (drawdowns) through the PBOC swap line.",Completion,Mixed,Loan,Loan,0.1,OOF-like,240,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,,,People's Bank of China (PBC),Government Agency,No,,,Bank Negara Malaysia,Recipient State-owned Bank,,,,Bank Negara Malaysia,Recipient State-owned Bank,,,,,,,Yes,Bank Negara Malaysia,Recipient State-owned Bank,,,"BNM deposit of MYR 4,416,000,000 in a bank account accessible to the PBOC",6558437637.0,CNY,,1016812036.74418,1016812036.74418,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2021-01-01,Yes,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,2022-01-01,,,,Bilateral Loan,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,Yes,,,,,No,Yes,,,,Other public sector debt,4,4,https://www.caixinglobal.com/upload/PBOC-2020-RMB-International-Report.pdf|http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4433239/2021122809344466286.pdf|https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/3026128/ar2020_en_ch4_finances.pdf|https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/6458991/ar2021_en_ch4.pdf,2020 RMB Internationalization Report|2021 RMB Internationalization Report|2020 Finances |2021 Finances ,The People's Bank of China|The People's Bank of China||,Donor/Recipient Official Source|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Donor/Recipient Official Source,,,Yes,Upper middle income,BNM made a drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC.

96202,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2020,,,BNM makes RMB 7.16 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2020 (Linked to Project ID#96203),"On February 8, 2009, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) — Malaysia’s central bank — and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 80 billion (MYR 40 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Malaysia. On February 8, 2012, BNM and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement and increased the maximum drawing rights from RMB 80 billion (MYR 40 billion) to RMB 180 billion (MYR 90 billion). BNM and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement — with maximum drawing rights of RMB 180 billion (MYR 90 billion) — again on April 17, 2015, August 20, 2018, and April 17, 2020. BNM made two (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement in 2020 and 2021: an RMB 7,169,923,934 (MYR 4,294,000,000) drawdown in 2020 and an RMB 6,558,437,637 (MYR 4,416,000,000) drawdown in 2021. The interest rate that applied to these borrowings is unknown. However, it is known that the maturity of each borrowing was approximately 1 year (12 months). It is also known that the amount outstanding under the PBOC swap line was RMB 7,169,923,934 (MYR 4,294,000,000) as of December 31, 2020 and RMB 6,558,437,637 (MYR 4,416,000,000) as of December 31, 2021. The 2020 drawdown is captured here and the 2021 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96203.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawdowns are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 4.

49309,No,1892,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2019,,,China Eximbank pledges MYR 37.4 billion loan for Phases 1 and 2 of East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73473 and Project ID#85858),"On September 26, 2016, the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) of Malaysia established a wholly-owned subsidiary and special purpose vehicle called Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL or MRLSB) to design, finance, implement, and maintain the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). Then, on November 1, 2016, China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) and MRLSB signed a commercial contract worth RMB 72.8 billion (46 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. China Eximbank and MRLSB subsequently signed a loan agreement worth RMB 61.88 billion (39.1 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. The loan reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, and 3.25% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of the November 1, 2016 commercial contract with CCCC. 60% of the loan was to be made available in renminbi (RMB), and the remaining 40% of the loan to be made available in ringgit. The Government of Malaysia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan. As of August 2018, the borrower had drawn down 19.69 billion ringgit from the loan.   On May 13, 2017, CCCC and MRLSB signed an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) contract worth RMB 14.2 billion (9 billion ringgit) for Phase 2 of the ECRL Project. However, there is no evidence of a loan agreement being signed with China Eximbank for Phase 2. The initial (combined) cost of Phases 1 and 2 was 55 billion ringgit, but it subsequently escalated to 65.5 billion ringgit. According to Malaysia's Ministry of Transport, as of July 3, 2018, MRLSB had paid 10.01 billion ringgit as advance payment for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Then, in August 2018, newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project and stated that the project could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half the value of the contracts that had been won by CCCC. After cancellation, China Eximbank informed the new Malaysian Government that it could either renegotiate the original contracts or pay termination costs of about 21.78 billion ringgit. The Malaysian Government chose to renegotiate. On April 12, 2019, CCCC and MRLSB signed a Supplemental Agreement (SA) regarding Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) for the ECRL Project, which reduced the overall cost of the ECRL Project from 65.5 billion ringgit to 44 billion ringgit. China Eximbank agreed — at least in principle — to revised the original loan agreement with MRLSB in order to finance 85% of the revised overall project cost (i.e. 37.4 billion ringgit). Under the SA, the parties also agreed to form a 50:50 joint-venture company to manage, operate and maintain the ECRL rail network. More details on the SA can be found in Staff Note 4. Project ID#85858 captures the portion (19.69 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was disbursed. Project ID#73473 captures the portion (19.41 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was cancelled. Project ID#49309 captures the revised loan (pledge) for Phases 1 and 2.   The purpose of the ECRL project is to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The railway will be used for both passenger and freight transportation from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia to its East Coast, and manage 80% of world maritime trade in the Straits of Malacca, linking major economies such as India, China, Japan, and South Korea. The railway will feature the following technical specifications: electrification via an overhead line, double tracking, standard gauges, operation by a driver, and will include a spur line, tunnel link, bridges, viaduct, depots, 23 total stations, and a signaling system. Traveling up to 200 km/h, this inter-city rail service plans to use eleven 8-car train sets for up to 600 passengers per set. Initial plans also indicate that these train sets will be built with eco-friendly and noise pollution reduction features, although information on this is not yet abundantly available. To transport cargo, the railway will use an electric locomotive with a haulage capacity of up to 45 wagons with 3500 tons of cargo. The estimated ridership of this railway service is 5.39 million people by 2030. Revenue from this project is estimated to derive from a transport ratio of 70% freight cargo business, and 30% passengers. While current travel to the East Coast of peninsular Malaysia takes about 12 hours, the ECRL alignment will shorten this travel time to 4-5 hours. The Eastern cities are also currently not connected to the west coast via rail. After a full public display of the proposed alignment, SPAD reported that 97% of Corridor residents were in support of the project.  The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.   CCCC is the contractor responsible for ECRL implementation and its work is being overseen by Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport through Agensi Pengangkutan Awam Darat (APAD). A groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 9, 2017. The project had achieved a 14.33% completion rate as of June 2018, which included the following implementation activities: setting up of base and satellite camps in all eight sections of the project, land acquisition, site clearing, and construction of road access. However, on July 3, 2018, MRLSB (the project owner) instructed CCCC to halt all works. Construction resumed on July 25, 2019, but as of March 2021, the project had still only achieved a 20% completion rate. The first (1.1 km) tunnel breakthrough took place on April 9, 2021 in Terengganu state. The originally expected project completion date was June 30, 2024, but it has been extended to December 31, 2026.  This project has been a subject of controversy and scandal. When the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition came into power after 2018 elections, it immediately raised concerns about artificial cost inflation and corruption in the China Eximbank-financed project. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project as well as a $2.5 billion Chinese-backed gas pipeline project and announced that he would seek to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the project contracts. He told the New York Times that “It’s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don’t need these projects in Malaysia.” Then, in January 2019, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Chinese Government had previously recommended that the previous government in Malaysia price these projects at above-market values in order to generate excess cash that it could use to repay the maturing debts of 1MDB (a state investment fund). The Prime Minister (Najib Razak) was, at the time, accused of stealing $681 million from 1MDB. He also reportedly asked Jho Low—the alleged mastermind of the crime—to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis.","1.During construction, MRLSB is the 100% project and asset owner of the ECRL rail network. During operation, it will be the 100% asset owner of the ECRL rail network. MRLSB will also form a 50:50 joint-venture with CCCC to jointly operate and maintain the rail network.2.MRLSB is wholly-owned by the Minister of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.). MOF Inc. is a corporate entity owned by the Government of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance that has the authority to enter into contracts, acquisitions, purchases, possessions, holdings and maintains tangible and intangible assets. As such, MRLSB is 100% owned by the Government of Malaysia. 3.In June 2018, CCCC provided an RM 10 billion bank guarantee to Malaysia Rail Link in the form of Advance Payment Bond. This guarantee was provided by Bank of China and China Eximbank. No separate records have been created to capture the advance payment bond from China Eximbank and Bank of China as they fall into the category of loan guarantees, which AidData does not separately record to avoid double-counting financial flows. 4.The SA covers Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) of the ECRL at a reduced cost of RM 44 billion. This is a significant reduction of RM21.5 billion or 32.8 percent, from its original cost of RM65.5 billion. There were three additional major changes introduced through the SA. First, CCCC agreed to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a joint venture company to be set up (MRLSB 50%: CCCC 50%). CCCC agreed to provide technical support and share the operational risk after the project’s completion. This arrangement was designed ease the financial burden on the Government of Malaysia, which was previously expected to bear the entire cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M.) Second, the percentage of local participation (content) was increased from 30 perecent to 40 percent of civil works. Third, CCCC agreed to refund part of the RM3.1 billion advance payment that MRLSB made for Phase 2. The SA also redefined the technical scope of Phase 1 and 2 in the following manner: 1. Standard gauge and double tracking of the ECRL is maintained. 2. 640km inclusive of spur lines 3. The ECRL will run through 20 stations, among others, from Kota Bahru to Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Mentakab and proceed to Jelebu, Bangi/Kajang, Putrajaya Sentral and onto Port Klang. Therefore, it will now pass through 5 States and WP Putrajaya from the previous 4 states, allowing more States to partake in the economic benefits of the improved deal. 4. The new Southern alignment will also provide a direct land link from Kuantan Port to Port Klang, serving as a land bridge between the two ports. 5. The new alignment will leverage on the existing KLIA Express Rail Link (ERL) as well as the future MRT2 SSP Line with an interchange in Putrajaya Sentral. This will improve passenger connectivity to other parts of the Peninsula’s West Coast as well as provide a direct link to KLIA. This is a significant improvement to the single interchange via LRT in ITT Gombak as per the previous arrangement. 6. Passengers on existing KTM Komuter and ETS Services from the Southern part of the Peninsula will interchange with the ECRL at the planned ECRL Bangi/Kajang station. 7. The new alignment also prioritize cultural, heritage and environmental factors by avoiding the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge in Gombak Selangor, the longest pure quartz dyke in the world. 8. The project’s expected completion date is revised from June 30, 2024 to to December 31, 2026.5.The Chinese project title is 马来西亚东海岸铁路项目.

purpose of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project is to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/12852777#map=8/4.826/102.571.",,,,,5,4,,

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations.

A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494.

92499,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2019,2016.0,2021.0,CDB provides EUR 89 million loan for Tanjung Kidurong Gas-fired Power Plant Project,"In 2019, China Development Bank issued an EUR 89 million loan to SEB Power Sdn Bhd — a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarawak Energy (the electric utility company of the Malaysian state of Sarawak) — for the 826MW Tanjung Kidurong Gas-fired Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance a £195.37 million ($238.62 million or RM 1 billion) EPC contract between Sarawak Energy and a consortium (consisting of GE Power Solutions (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, GE (Switzerland) GmbH, Sinohydro Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd, and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd), which was signed on October 28, 2016. The purpose of the project is to construct one of two 421 MW power generation units at the 826 MW combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant within the existing Tanjung Kidurong (Bintulu) power station, which is located approximately 6 km away from the Bintulu sea port, in the Kidurong Industrial Park, Bintulu province, Sarawak, Malaysia. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 3.2899, 113.0942. Each power generation unit (or ‘block’) will be equipped with a GE F-class gas turbine, a steam turbine, and a waste heat recovery boiler in a multi-shaft configuration that also enables open-cycle, as well as dual fuel operations. Incorporating innovative twin combustor design that involves the environmental vortex (EV) as well as the sequential EV (SEV) combustors, the gas turbine features low exhaust emission and greater operating flexibility. The project will utilize an integrated cooling water system comprising three 1.1km-long and 2.5diameter sub-sea, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) water intake and drainage pipes. The electricity generated by the project will be evacuated into the grid through a 275kV power transmission line via a gas insulated substation (GIS).   GE Power Solutions (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, GE (Switzerland) GmbH, Sinohydro Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd, and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. Several subcontractors are also involved. China’s Eight Bureau of Power Construction Hydropower and Hubei Engineering Company Construction Company were engaged for the construction works of the project. Vantage Steek Works and Kemuning Engineering were engaged for the supply, fabrication, and erection of steel structure. Sarens was contracted for the equipment lifting and installation operations, while Flenco was subcontracted by GE Switzerland for the supply of auxiliary systems for unit one of the combined-cycle project. KASI Malaysia was appointed by Sinohydro Corporation for the marine traffic risk analysis (MTRA) of the cooling water intake pipeline.   In April 2018, a social and environmental impact assessment (SEIA) was undertaken by Chemsain Consultant in line with the requirements of the Equator Principles risk management framework and in compliance with with national requirements as well as the Performance Standard of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Then, in May 2018, an Environmental and Social Due Diligence exercise was conducted by an international independent environmental and social consultant. Unit 1 construction started in November 2016. Its gas turbine was successfully ignited in November 2019. Unit 1 was then connected to the grid on July 30, 2020 and was put into commercial operation on January 20, 2021 (11 days ahead of schedule).","1. This project is also known as the Tanjung Kidurong Combine Cycle Power Plant Project. The Chinese project title is 马来西亚沙捞越州Kidurong燃气电站项目 or 马来西亚凯德隆火电站(Tanjung Kidurong Combined Cycle Power Plant)凯德隆电厂扩建项目 or 凯德隆火电项目. 2. The precise date on which the CDB loan agreement was signed is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that it took place during calendar year 2019 since the 2019 annual report of Sarawak Energy (https://www.sarawakenergy.com/assets/pdf/Sarawak-Energy-ASR2019_AR-Part.pdf) indicates that ‘our wholly-owned subsidiary SEB Power Sdn Bhd successfully secured its first Export Credit Agency financing for Block 1 of the Tanjung Kidurong Combined Cycle Power Plant.’ 3. For the time being, AidData has coded the flow variable as an export buyer’s credit since the borrower refers to the financing that it secured as ‘export credit’ financing. 4. For the purpose of financing, the 826MW Tanjung Kidurong Gas-fired Power Plant Project has been split into two lots: a £195.37 million ($238.62 million or RM 1 billion) commercial contract for the first (421 MW) power generation unit (‘Unit 1’), which was signed ini October 2016; and a £273 million ($364.41 million) commercial contract with the same consortium for the second (421 MW) power generation unit (‘Unit 2’).

73473,No,1892,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2018,2017.0,,[Cancelled Portion] China Eximbank provides RM 39.1 billion preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#49309 and Project ID #85858),"On September 26, 2016, the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) of Malaysia established a wholly-owned subsidiary and special purpose vehicle called Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL or MRLSB) to design, finance, implement, and maintain the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). Then, on November 1, 2016, China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) and MRLSB signed a commercial contract worth RMB 72.8 billion (46 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. China Eximbank and MRLSB subsequently signed a loan agreement worth RMB 61.88 billion (39.1 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. The loan reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, and 3.25% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of the November 1, 2016 commercial contract with CCCC. 60% of the loan was to be made available in renminbi (RMB), and the remaining 40% of the loan to be made available in ringgit. The loan was reported to be in the form of preferential buyer's credit. The Government of Malaysia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan. As of August 2018, the borrower had drawn down 19.69 billion ringgit from the loan.   On May 13, 2017, CCCC and MRLSB signed an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) contract worth RMB 14.2 billion (9 billion ringgit) for Phase 2 of the ECRL Project. However, there is no evidence of a loan agreement being signed with China Eximbank for Phase 2. The initial (combined) cost of Phases 1 and 2 was 55 billion ringgit, but it subsequently escalated to 65.5 billion ringgit. According to Malaysia's Ministry of Transport, as of July 3, 2018, MRLSB had paid 10.01 billion ringgit as advance payment for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Then, in August 2018, newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project and stated that the project could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half the value of the contracts that had been won by CCCC. After cancellation, China Eximbank informed the new Malaysian Government that it could either renegotiate the original contracts or pay termination costs of about 21.78 billion ringgit. The Malaysian Government chose to renegotiate. On April 12, 2019, CCCC and MRLSB signed a Supplemental Agreement (SA) regarding Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) for the ECRL Project, which reduced the overall cost of the ECRL Project from 65.5 billion ringgit to 44 billion ringgit. China Eximbank agreed — at least in principle — to revised the original loan agreement with MRLSB in order to finance 85% of the revised overall project cost (i.e. 37.4 billion ringgit). Under the SA, the parties also agreed to form a 50:50 joint-venture company to manage, operate and maintain the ECRL rail network. More details on the SA can be found in Staff Note. Project ID#85858 captures the portion (19.69 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was disbursed. Project ID#73473 captures the portion (19.41 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was cancelled. Project ID#49309 captures the revised loan for Phases 1 and 2.   The purpose of the ECRL project is to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The railway will be used for both passenger and freight transportation from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia to its East Coast, and manage 80% of world maritime trade in the Straits of Malacca, linking major economies such as India, China, Japan, and South Korea. The railway will feature the following technical specifications: electrification via an overhead line, double tracking, standard gauges, operation by a driver, and will include a spur line, tunnel link, bridges, viaduct, depots, 23 total stations, and a signaling system. Traveling up to 200 km/h, this inter-city rail service plans to use eleven 8-car train sets for up to 600 passengers per set. Initial plans also indicate that these train sets will be built with eco-friendly and noise pollution reduction features, although information on this is not yet abundantly available. To transport cargo, the railway will use an electric locomotive with a haulage capacity of up to 45 wagons with 3500 tons of cargo. The estimated ridership of this railway service is 5.39 million people by 2030. Revenue from this project is estimated to derive from a transport ratio of 70% freight cargo business, and 30% passengers. While current travel to the East Coast of peninsular Malaysia takes about 12 hours, the ECRL alignment will shorten this travel time to 4-5 hours. The Eastern cities are also currently not connected to the west coast via rail. After a full public display of the proposed alignment, SPAD reported that 97% of Corridor residents were in support of the project.  The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.   China Communications Construction Co., Ltd. (CCCC) is the contractor responsible for ECRL implementation and its work is being overseen by Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport through Agensi Pengangkutan Awam Darat (APAD). A groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 9, 2017. The project had achieved a 14.33% completion rate as of June 2018, which included the following implementation activities: setting up of base and satellite camps in all eight sections of the project, land acquisition, site clearing, and construction of road access. However, on July 3, 2018, MRLSB (the project owner) instructed CCCC to halt all works. Construction resumed on July 25, 2019, but as of March 2021, the project had still only achieved a 20% completion rate. The first (1.1 km) tunnel breakthrough took place on April 9, 2021 in Terengganu state. The originally expected project completion date was June 30, 2024, but it has been extended to December 31, 2026.  This project has been a subject of controversy and scandal. When the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition came into power after 2018 elections, it immediately raised concerns about artificial cost inflation and corruption in the China Eximbank-financed project. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project as well as a $2.5 billion Chinese-backed gas pipeline project and announced that he would seek to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the project contracts. He told the New York Times that “It’s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don’t need these projects in Malaysia.” Then, in January 2019, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Chinese Government had previously recommended that the previous government in Malaysia price these projects at above-market values in order to generate excess cash that it could use to repay the maturing debts of 1MDB (a state investment fund). The Prime Minister (Najib Razak) was, at the time, accused of stealing $681 million from 1MDB. He also reportedly asked Jho Low—the alleged mastermind of the crime—to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis.","1.During construction, MRLSB is the 100% project and asset owner of the ECRL rail network. During operation, it will be the 100% asset owner of the ECRL rail network. MRLSB will also form a 50:50 joint-venture with CCCC to jointly operate and maintain the rail network.2.MRLSB is wholly-owned by the Minister of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.). MOF Inc. is a corporate entity owned by the Government of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance that has the authority to enter into contracts, acquisitions, purchases, possessions, holdings and maintains tangible and intangible assets. As such, MRLSB is 100% owned by the Government of Malaysia. 3.In June 2018, CCCC provided an RM 10 billion bank guarantee to Malaysia Rail Link in the form of Advance Payment Bond. This guarantee was provided by Bank of China and China Eximbank. No separate records have been created to capture the advance payment bond from China Eximbank and Bank of China as they fall into the category of loan guarantees, which AidData does not separately record to avoid double-counting financial flows. 4.The SA covers Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) of the ECRL at a reduced cost of RM 44 billion. This is a significant reduction of RM21.5 billion or 32.8 percent, from its original cost of RM65.5 billion. There were three additional major changes introduced through the SA. First, CCCC agreed to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a joint venture company to be set up (MRLSB 50%: CCCC 50%). CCCC agreed to provide technical support and share the operational risk after the project’s completion. This arrangement was designed to ease the financial burden on the Government of Malaysia, which was previously expected to bear the entire cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M.) Second, the percentage of local participation (content) was increased from 30 percent to 40 percent of civil works. Third, CCCC agreed to refund part of the RM3.1 billion advance payment that MRLSB made for Phase 2. The SA also redefined the technical scope of Phase 1 and 2 in the following manner: 1. Standard gauge and double tracking of the ECRL is maintained. 2. 640km inclusive of spur lines 3. The ECRL will run through 20 stations, among others, from Kota Bahru to Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Mentakab and proceed to Jelebu, Bangi/Kajang, Putrajaya Sentral and onto Port Klang. Therefore, it will now pass through 5 States and WP Putrajaya from the previous 4 states, allowing more States to partake in the economic benefits of the improved deal. 4. The new Southern alignment will also provide a direct land link from Kuantan Port to Port Klang, serving as a land bridge between the two ports.5. The new alignment will leverage on the existing KLIA Express Rail Link (ERL) as well as the future MRT2 SSP Line with an interchange in Putrajaya Sentral. This will improve passenger connectivity to other parts of the Peninsula’s West Coast as well as provide a direct link to KLIA. This is a significant improvement to the single interchange via LRT in ITT Gombak as per the previous arrangement. 6. Passengers on existing KTM Komuter and ETS Services from the Southern part of the Peninsula will interchange with the ECRL at the planned ECRL Bangi/Kajang station. 7. The new alignment also prioritize cultural, heritage and environmental factors by avoiding the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge in Gombak Selangor, the longest pure quartz dyke in the world. 8. The project’s expected completion date is revised from June 30, 2024 to to December 31, 2026. 5. The Chinese project title is 马来西亚东海岸铁路项目. 6. The precise loan commitment date is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the loan commitment year is 2018 (the first year in which there is evidence of the loan disbursing). However, this issue warrants further investigation.

the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project is to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.

85858,Yes,1892,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2018,2017.0,,[Disbursed Portion] China Eximbank provides RM 39.1 billion preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#49309 and ID#73473),"On September 26, 2016, the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) of Malaysia established a wholly-owned subsidiary and special purpose vehicle called Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL or MRLSB) to design, finance, implement, and maintain the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). Then, on November 1, 2016, China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) and MRLSB signed a commercial contract worth RMB 72.8 billion (46 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. China Eximbank and MRLSB subsequently signed a loan agreement — in the form of a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement — worth RMB 61.88 billion (39.1 billion ringgit) for Phase 1 of the ECRL Project. The loan reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and 3.25% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of the November 1, 2016 commercial contract with CCCC. 60% of the loan was to be made available in renminbi (RMB), and the remaining 40% of the loan to be made available in ringgit. The Government of Malaysia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan. As of August 2018, the borrower had drawn down 19.69 billion ringgit (RM) from the loan, which implies a disbursement rate of 50.3%. The 19.69 billion ringgit was used by the borrower for (1) an advance payment of RM 10.02 billion to CCCC, and (2) a progress payment of RM 9.67 billion to CCCC. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was approximately $3.264 billion (RM 13.6 billion).   On May 13, 2017, CCCC and MRLSB signed an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) contract worth RMB 14.2 billion (9 billion ringgit) for Phase 2 of the ECRL Project. However, there is no evidence of a loan agreement being signed with China Eximbank for Phase 2. The initial (combined) cost of Phases 1 and 2 was 55 billion ringgit, but it subsequently escalated to 65.5 billion ringgit (RM). According to Malaysia's Ministry of Transport, as of July 3, 2018, MRLSB had paid 10.01 billion ringgit as advance payment for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Then, in August 2018, newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project and stated that the project could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half the value of the contracts that had been won by CCCC. After cancellation, China Eximbank informed the new Malaysian Government that it could either renegotiate the original contracts or pay termination costs of about 21.78 billion ringgit. The Malaysian Government chose to renegotiate. On April 12, 2019, CCCC and MRLSB signed a Supplemental Agreement (SA) regarding Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) for the ECRL Project, which reduced the overall cost of the ECRL Project from 65.5 billion ringgit to 44 billion ringgit. China Eximbank agreed — at least in principle — to revised the original loan agreement with MRLSB in order to finance 85% of the revised overall project cost (i.e. 37.4 billion ringgit). Under the SA, the parties also agreed to form a 50:50 joint-venture company to manage, operate and maintain the ECRL rail network. More details on the SA can be found in Staff Note 4. Project ID#85858 captures the portion (19.69 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was disbursed. Project ID#73473 captures the portion (19.41 billion ringgit) of the loan agreement for Phase 1 that was cancelled. Project ID#49309 captures the revised loan for Phases 1 and 2.   The purpose of the ECRL project is to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The railway will be used for both passenger and freight transportation from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia to its East Coast, and manage 80% of world maritime trade in the Straits of Malacca, linking major economies such as India, China, Japan, and South Korea. The railway will feature the following technical specifications: electrification via an overhead line, double tracking, standard gauges, operation by a driver, and will include a spur line, tunnel link, bridges, viaduct, depots, 23 total stations, and a signaling system. Traveling up to 200 km/h, this inter-city rail service plans to use eleven 8-car train sets for up to 600 passengers per set. Initial plans also indicate that these train sets will be built with eco-friendly and noise pollution reduction features, although information on this is not yet abundantly available. To transport cargo, the railway will use an electric locomotive with a haulage capacity of up to 45 wagons with 3500 tons of cargo. The estimated ridership of this railway service is 5.39 million people by 2030. Revenue from this project is estimated to derive from a transport ratio of 70% freight cargo business, and 30% passengers. While current travel to the East Coast of peninsular Malaysia takes about 12 hours, the ECRL alignment will shorten this travel time to 4-5 hours. The Eastern cities are also currently not connected to the west coast via rail. After a full public display of the proposed alignment, SPAD reported that 97% of Corridor residents were in support of the project.   The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.   CCCC is the contractor responsible for ECRL implementation and its work is being overseen by Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport through Agensi Pengangkutan Awam Darat (APAD). A groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 9, 2017. The project had achieved a 14.33% completion rate as of June 2018, which included the following implementation activities: setting up of base and satellite camps in all eight sections of the project, land acquisition, site clearing, and construction of road access. However, on July 3, 2018, MRLSB (the project owner) instructed CCCC to halt all works. Construction resumed on July 25, 2019, but as of March 2021, the project had still only achieved a 20% completion rate. The first (1.1 km) tunnel breakthrough took place on April 9, 2021 in Terengganu state. Then, on June 23, 2022, and inauguration ceremony for the Genting twin tunnel dredging of the ECRL project took place The excavation of the 16.39 km Genting Tunnel is the only one of the 59 tunnels drilling using the TBM method compared to the drilling and blasting method for the previous tunnels. This 1,600 ton Chinese-made TBM machine is capable of penetrating the Titiwangsa Range along the Bukit Tinggi area connecting Bentong, Pahang with the Gombak Integrated Terminal, which is the main entrance to the capital. The construction of the Genting Twin Tunnel is one of the main components of the ECRL Project as it can complete the 'land bridge' or landbridge for the transportation of cargo from Kuantan Port to Port Klang. As of June 2022, the project had achieved a 30% completion rate. The originally expected project completion date was June 30, 2024, but it was later extended to December 31, 2026.   This project has been a subject of controversy, scandal, and continual renegotiation. When the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition came into power after 2018 elections, it immediately raised concerns about artificial cost inflation and corruption in the China Eximbank-financed project. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled the ECRL project as well as a $2.5 billion Chinese-backed gas pipeline project and announced that he would seek to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the project contracts. He told the New York Times that “It’s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don’t need these projects in Malaysia.” Then, in January 2019, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Chinese Government had previously recommended that the previous government in Malaysia price these projects at above-market values in order to generate excess cash that it could use to repay the maturing debts of 1MDB (a state investment fund). The Prime Minister (Najib Razak) was, at the time, accused of stealing $681 million from 1MDB. He also reportedly asked Jho Low—the alleged mastermind of the crime—to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis. Then, in February 2020, Malaysia experienced a political crisis that resulted in the ousting of the ruling party (Pakatan Harapan ) and the appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin as the eighth prime minister under the new coalition government of Perikatan Nasional. As early as July 2020, there were reports that the Malaysian government would consider a proposal to further change the ECRL’s Section C track alignment back to its original alignment under the Najib Razak administration. On September 2, 2020, it was reported that the Cabinet had reviewed and approved the proposal to further change the ECRL track alignment, primarily to revert back to its Northern alignment for the Section C portion. On April 5, 2021, the Minister of Transport Wee Ka Siong officially announced the government’s intention to change the scope of the ECRL alignment. Then, in June 2022, the Government of Malaysia identified the total cost of the project as RM 50.27 billion. ","1: During construction, MRLSB is the 100% project and asset owner of the ECRL rail network. During operation, will be the 100% asset owner of the ECRL rail network. MRLSB will also form a 50:50 joint-venture with CCCC to jointly operate and maintain the rail network.2: MRLSB is wholly-owned by the Minister of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.). MOF Inc. is a corporate entity owned by the Government of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance that has the authority to enter into contracts, acquisitions, purchases, possessions, holdings and maintains tangible and intangible assets. As such, MRLSB is 100% owned by the Government of Malaysia. 3: In June 2018, CCCC provided an RM 10 billion bank guarantee to Malaysia Rail Link in the form of Advance Payment Bond. This guarantee was provided by Bank of China and China Eximbank. No separate records have been created to capture the advance payment bond from China Eximbank and Bank of China as they fall into the category of loan guarantees, which AidData does not separately record to avoid double-counting financial flows. 4: The SA covers Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) of the ECRL at a reduced cost of RM 44 billion. This is a significant reduction of RM21.5 billion or 32.8 percent, from its original cost of RM65.5 billion. There were three additional major changes introduced through the SA. First, CCCC agreed to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a joint venture company to be set up (MRLSB 50%: CCCC 50%). CCCC agreed to provide technical support and share the operational risk after the project’s completion. This arrangement was designed ease the financial burden on the Government of Malaysia, which was previously expected to bear the entire cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M.) Second, the percentage of local participation (content) was increased from 30 perecent to 40 percent of civil works. Third, CCCC agreed to refund part of the RM3.1 billion advance payment that MRLSB made for Phase 2. The SA also redefined the technical scope of Phase 1 and 2 in the following manner: 1. Standard gauge and double tracking of the ECRL is maintained. 2. 640km inclusive of spur lines 3. The ECRL will run through 20 stations, among others, from Kota Bahru to Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Mentakab and proceed to Jelebu, Bangi/Kajang, Putrajaya Sentral and onto Port Klang. Therefore, it will now pass through 5 States and WP Putrajaya from the previous 4 states, allowing more States to partake in the economic benefits of the improved deal. 4. The new Southern alignment will also provide a direct land link from Kuantan Port to Port Klang, serving as a land bridge between the two ports. 5. The new alignment will leverage on the existing KLIA Express Rail Link (ERL) as well as the future MRT2 SSP Line with an interchange in Putrajaya Sentral. This will improve passenger connectivity to other parts of the Peninsula’s West Coast as well as provide a direct link to KLIA. This is a significant improvement to the single interchange via LRT in ITT Gombak as per the previous arrangement. 6. Passengers on existing KTM Komuter and ETS Services from the Southern part of the Peninsula will interchange with the ECRL at the planned ECRL Bangi/Kajang station. 7. The new alignment also prioritize cultural, heritage and environmental factors by avoiding the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge in Gombak Selangor, the longest pure quartz dyke in the world. 8. The project’s expected completion date is revised from June 30, 2024 to to December 31, 2026.5: The Chinese project title is 马来西亚东海岸铁路项目. 6. The precise loan commitment date is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the loan commitment year is 2018 (the first year in which there is evidence of the loan disbursing). However, this issue warrants further investigation.

to build a 688 km railway that connects Kuala Lumpur, the nation’s capital, to Kota Bharu via the East Coast Economic Region through Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelentan states. The ECRL is being built in two main phases. Phase 1 will entail a route in the following order: Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Bentong, Gombak. The line will span a total of 600.3 km and have 23 stations. In an approximately four-hour trip, Wakaf Bharu in Kelentan will be connected to Gombak Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT Gombak) in Kuala Lumpur. ITT Gombak provides the potential to connect with the existing Kelana Jaya Line and a long-distance bus terminal. This construction phase will also include tunnel work in the Gombak-Bentong area, with the single longest tunnel spanning 18km under the Titiwangsa Mountains. Some parts of the line near the Kuala Lumpur city center in Gombak will be built underground. Construction will begin at the northern end of the rail in Kelantan. Phase 2 of construction will be much shorter, and will connect ITT Gombak to Port Klang for a total of 88 km of railway.

89485,Yes,31,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2018,,,"Bank of China contributes to $8 billion syndicated bridge loan for Project Marigold (Linked to Project ID#89496, #89494, #89495, #89486, #89497, and #89498)","On March 28, 2018, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd (collectively known as PRefChem) were legally incorporated as joint ventures owned by Petronas (50% equity stake) and Saudi Aramco (50% equity stake). PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

89486,Yes,31,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2018,,,"ICBC contributes to $8 billion syndicated bridge loan for Project Marigold (Linked to Project ID#89496, #89494, #89495, #89486, #89497, and #89498)","On March 28, 2018, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd (collectively known as PRefChem) were legally incorporated as joint ventures owned by Petronas (50% equity stake) and Saudi Aramco (50% equity stake). PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

Ltd. (Chinese: 隆基绿能科技股份有限公司) signed a $200 million syndicated loan agreement with a group of Chinese state-owned banks. The participants in the loan syndicate included Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Malaysia) Berhad, and the Shaanxi Branch of the Export-Import Bank of China. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) was mandated as sole arranger of the transaction and it contributed approximately $100 million to the syndicate. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Malaysia) Berhad and the Shaanxi Branch of the Export-Import Bank of China each contributed approximately $50 million to the syndicated loan. The joint contribution of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Malaysia) Berhad and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) is captured via Project ID#92509. China Eximbank’s contribution is captured via Project ID#92510. The loan carried a 5-year maturity and it was backed by a corporate guarantee from LONGI (H.K.) Trading Limited. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to build a new 1GW monocrystalline solar cell manufacturing plant in the Shama (Sama) Jaya Free Industrial Park, Kuching City, Sarawak, Malaysia.   Prior to the issuance of the syndicated loan, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. Ltd. owned and operated a 500MW mono solar cell and 500MW of module assembly production in the in the Shama Jaya Free Industrial Park, Kuching City, Sarawak, Malaysia. LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. Ltd. said that the capacity expansion — financed with the proceeds of the syndicated loan — was intended to meet demand in overseas markets and further expand its manufacturing footprint outside China. The additionally capacity was originally expected to come online in 2019, providing the company with a total of 6GW of in-house mono cell capacity. However, the expansion project appears to have been delayed by the Covid-19 global pandemic. In February 2022, the company announced that it expected to complete the expansion project by the end of the third quarter of 2022.","1. LONGi Green Energy Technology Co.

62285,Yes,2247,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2017,2017.0,,[Disbursed Portion] China Eximbank disburses RMB 11.32 billion via loan for Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline and Multi-Product Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#62286),"On March 22, 2017, Suria Strategic Energy Resources Sdn Bhd (SSER)— a special purpose vehicle that is wholly owned by the Government of Malaysia — signed a loan agreement worth RMB 12,877,000,000 (or RM 7,814,000,000) for the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline and Multi-Product Pipeline Construction Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 3.25% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of Malaysia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was to expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of two separate Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) contracts: an RMB 3.08 billion (RM 4.06 billion) EPCC contract for the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline (TSGP) Project that was issued to China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Company Ltd (CPPE) on November 1, 2016 and an RMB 4.5475 billion (RM 5.35 billion) EPCC contract for the Multi-Product Pipeline (MPP) Project that was issued to CPPE on November 1, 2016.   As of May 27, 2019, the China Eximbank loan had achieved an 88% disbursement rate [RMB 11,320,000,000 (RM 6,869,000,000 or $1.65 billion) out of RMB 12,877,000,000]. The loan’s (principal) outstanding amount was approximately $1.656 billion (RM 6.9 billion) as of December 31, 2018.    The TSGP involves the construction of a 662 km gas pipeline from Kimanis Gas Terminal facilities to gas turbine power generation plants in Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Tawau. The objective of the project is to install all required facilities such as pipeline, sub-transmission stations, remote control block valve stations and all other related equipment to transport 300 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of natural gas. The MPP involves the construction of a 600 km multi-product petroleum pipeline connecting Melaka and Port Dickson to Jitra, Kedah. The ingresses are Melaka refinery, Port Dickson (HRC) refinery and Port Dickson (PETRON) refinery. The egresses are Sitiawan, Kulim and Jitra. The designed capacity of pipeline is up to 307,000 barrels a day (kbpd).   CPPE and Huanqiu Project Management (Beijing) Co Ltd (HQPMC) were the contractors responsible for implementation. The MPP and TSGP commenced in April 2017. However, the Malaysian Government referred the projects to the country’s anti-corruption authorities when it learned that 88% of the value of the two EPCC contracts was paid by SSER despite the fact that the TSGP only achieved an 11.4% (unverified and unaudited) completion rate and the MPP only achieved a 14.5% (unverified and unaudited) completion rate. It also terminated the two EPCC contracts with CPPE on September 6, 2018. Then, on January 15, 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) — the Malaysian central bank — issued two summons detailing 6 charges against SSER for failing to abide by Section 214 (2) and (5) of the Financial Services Act 2013. The 6 charges were: 1. The disbursement of loan of 88% of project value was not in accordance with the progress of the MPP at 13% of work done, which remains unverified or unaudited. 2. The failure to ensure good and effective governance practice in the management and implementation of the MPP. 3. The failure to obtain BNM’s approval for changes in the project timeline of the MPP. 4. The disbursement of loan was not in accordance with the progress of the TSGP. 5. The failure to ensure good and effective governance practice in the management and implementation of the TSGP. 6. The failure to obtain BNM’s approval for changes in the project timeline of the TSGP. On April 5, 2019, the Sessions Court fined SSER RM 3 million for each offense committed for a total of RM 18 million penalty. SSER paid the fines. Then, in July 2019, the Malaysian government was reportedly negotiating to reclaim funds from CPPE. Several months later, in September 2019, Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, a special officer to former Prime Minister Najib Razak, testified before the country’s High Court, that Razak had sent him on a ‘secret mission’ to Beijing to seek a China Eximbank loan agreement for the MPP and TSGP but that the Prime Minister’s true intention was to use the proceeds from the China Eximbank to bail out the deeply-indebted 1MDB (state investment fund).   Then, in early October 2021, Malaysia's Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul revealed to parliament that the TSGP had been revived under Muhyiddin Yassin’s Perikatan Nasional (PN) government on February 10, 2021. Since the controversial announcement of the TSGP’s resumption, multiple concerns regarding the project’s transparency and financial viability have resurfaced. Pakatan Harapan’s leaders have demanded a thorough investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the project’s revival, emphasizing that they were 'extremely shocked' by Muhyiddin’s decision.  Project ID#62285 captures the portion (RMB 11,320,000,000) of the China Eximbank loan that was disbursed. Project ID#62286 captures the cancellation of the funding for the MPP and the TSGP (RMB 12,877,000,000).","1. The Chinese project title is 600公里长多元产品石化管道 or 多元石油產品输送管 or 沙巴天然气运输管道工程.2. SSER is a wholly-owned Minister of Finance Inc. (MOF Inc.). subsidiary set up on May 19, 2016 to undertake the Multi-Product Pipeline (MPP) and the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline (TSGP) projects. MOF Inc. is a corporate entity owned by the Government of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance that has the authority to enter into contracts, acquisitions, purchases, possessions, holdings and maintains tangible and intangible assets.3. In 2015, Malaysia's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion (approximately $700 million) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) — a government-run investment fund — to his personal bank accounts. The event triggered widespread criticism among Malaysians, with many calling for Najib Razak's resignation –- including Mahathir Mohamad, one of Najib's predecessors as prime minister, who later defeated Najib in the 2018 general election and returned to power. Razak reportedly asked Low Taek Jho (commonly referred to as Jho Low) to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis. Jho Low is also accused of being the mastermind of an elaborate effort to defraud 1MDB. In October 2016, Interpol published a red notice at Singapore's request to locate and arrest Low in an investigation related to 1MDB scandal.

62286,No,2247,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2017,2017.0,,[Cancelled Portion] China Eximbank provides RMB 12.87 billion loan for Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline and Multi-Product Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#62285),"On March 22, 2017, Suria Strategic Energy Resources Sdn Bhd (SSER)— a special purpose vehicle that is wholly owned by the Government of Malaysia — signed a loan agreement worth RMB 12,877,000,000 (or RM 7,814,000,000) for the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline and Multi-Product Pipeline Construction Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 3.25% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of Malaysia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was to expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of two separate Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) contracts: an RMB 3.08 billion (RM 4.06 billion) EPCC contract for the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline (TSGP) Project that was issued to China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Company Ltd (CPPE) on November 1, 2016 and an RMB 4.5475 billion (RM 5.35 billion) EPCC contract for the Multi-Product Pipeline (MPP) Project that was issued to CPPE on November 1, 2016.   As of May 27, 2019, the China Eximbank loan had achieved an 88% disbursement rate [RMB 11,320,000,000 (RM 6,869,000,000 or $1.65 billion) out of RMB 12,877,000,000]. The loan’s (principal) outstanding amount was approximately $1.656 billion (RM 6.9 billion) as of December 31, 2018.    The TSGP involves the construction of a 662 km gas pipeline from Kimanis Gas Terminal facilities to gas turbine power generation plants in Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Tawau. The objective of the project is to install all required facilities such as pipeline, sub-transmission stations, remote control block valve stations and all other related equipment to transport 300 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of natural gas. The MPP involves the construction of a 600 km multi-product petroleum pipeline connecting Melaka and Port Dickson to Jitra, Kedah. The ingresses are Melaka refinery, Port Dickson (HRC) refinery and Port Dickson (PETRON) refinery. The egresses are Sitiawan, Kulim and Jitra. The designed capacity of pipeline is up to 307,000 barrels a day (kbpd).   CPPE and Huanqiu Project Management (Beijing) Co Ltd (HQPMC) were the contractors responsible for implementation. The MPP and TSGP commenced in April 2017. However, the Malaysian Government referred the projects to the country’s anti-corruption authorities when it learned that 88% of the value of the two EPCC contracts was paid by SSER despite the fact that the TSGP only achieved an 11.4% (unverified and unaudited) completion rate and the MPP only achieved a 14.5% (unverified and unaudited) completion rate. It also terminated the two EPCC contracts with CPPE on September 6, 2018. Then, on January 15, 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) — the Malaysian central bank — issued two summons detailing 6 charges against SSER for failing to abide by Section 214 (2) and (5) of the Financial Services Act 2013. The 6 charges were: 1. The disbursement of loan of 88% of project value was not in accordance with the progress of the MPP at 13% of work done, which remains unverified or unaudited. 2. The failure to ensure good and effective governance practice in the management and implementation of the MPP. 3. The failure to obtain BNM’s approval for changes in the project timeline of the MPP. 4. The disbursement of loan was not in accordance with the progress of the TSGP. 5. The failure to ensure good and effective governance practice in the management and implementation of the TSGP. 6. The failure to obtain BNM’s approval for changes in the project timeline of the TSGP. On April 5, 2019, the Sessions Court fined SSER RM 3 million for each offense committed for a total of RM 18 million penalty. SSER paid the fines. Then, in July 2019, the Malaysian government was reportedly negotiating to reclaim funds from CPPE. Several months later, in September 2019, Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, a special officer to former Prime Minister Najib Razak, testified before the country’s High Court, that Razak had sent him on a ‘secret mission’ to Beijing to seek a China Eximbank loan agreement for the MPP and TSGP but that the Prime Minister’s true intention was to use the proceeds from the China Eximbank to bail out the deeply-indebted 1MDB (state investment fund).   Then, in early October 2021, Malaysia's Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul revealed to parliament that the TSGP had been revived under Muhyiddin Yassin’s Perikatan Nasional (PN) government on February 10, 2021. Since the controversial announcement of the TSGP’s resumption, multiple concerns regarding the project’s transparency and financial viability have resurfaced. Pakatan Harapan’s leaders have demanded a thorough investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the project’s revival, emphasizing that they were 'extremely shocked' by Muhyiddin’s decision.  Project ID#62285 captures the portion (RMB 11,320,000,000) of the China Eximbank loan that was disbursed. Project ID#62286 captures the cancellation of the funding for the MPP and the TSGP (RMB 12,877,000,000).","1. The Chinese project title is 600公里长多元产品石化管道 or 多元石油產品输送管 or 沙巴天然气运输管道工程.2. SSER is a wholly-owned Minister of Finance Inc. (MOF Inc.). subsidiary set up on May 19, 2016 to undertake the Multi-Product Pipeline (MPP) and the Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline (TSGP) projects. MOF Inc. is a corporate entity owned by the Government of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance that has the authority to enter into contracts, acquisitions, purchases, possessions, holdings and maintains tangible and intangible assets.3.  In 2015, Malaysia's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion (approximately $700 million) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) — a government-run investment fund — to his personal bank accounts. The event triggered widespread criticism among Malaysians, with many calling for Najib Razak's resignation –- including Mahathir Mohamad, one of Najib's predecessors as prime minister, who later defeated Najib in the 2018 general election and returned to power. Razak reportedly asked Low Taek Jho (commonly referred to as Jho Low) to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis. Jho Low is also accused of being the mastermind of an elaborate effort to defraud 1MDB. In October 2016, Interpol published a red notice at Singapore's request to locate and arrest Low in an investigation related to 1MDB scandal. Then, in November 2020, Al-Jazeera reported that Low was currently living in Macau, in ‘a house owned by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party’.4.

92505,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2017,2015.0,2018.0,China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. provides MYR 46.5 million interest-free loan for Astaka @ One Bukit Senyum Project,"On December 18, 2014, Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd (APSD)— a property management company in Johor Bahru, Malaysia and wholly owned subsidiary of Astaka Holdings — appointed China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. to carry out the construction works for the Astaka @ One Bukit Senyum Project. APSD then issued a $200 million (RM 640 million) construction contract to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. on August 2, 2015. Per the terms of the construction contract, CSCE was required to complete the project by November 4, 2017. A progress claim for certificate no. 21 to 23 was received between December 5, 2016 and February 2, 2017. The outstanding amount owed to CSCE for certificate claims no. 21, 22, 23 was RM 46,532,461.19.   Then, on April 12, 2017, APSB entered into an RM 46,532,461.19 interest-free loan agreement with China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. RM 46,532,461.19 represented the amount that APSB owed to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd as at February 28, 2017 (for progress claims issued by China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd to APSB). APSB proposed the loan to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. because APSB was unable to make payments for progress payment claims under certificate no. 21 to 23 due to cash flow problems. The loan was to be repaid by June 30, 2017 or upon APSB's receipt of a written demand from China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. at any time after the date of loan agreement, whichever was earlier. In the event that APSB was unable to repay the loan on such repayment date, China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd would upon receipt of APSB’s written request grant APSB a final extension of time until September 30, 2017 ( an “Extended Due Date”) to repay the loan, provided that late interest would be charged at a rate of 8.5% per annum on the outstanding balance of the loan until its date of full repayment. The loan was secured (i.e. collateralized) against land parcels located in Bukit Pelali owned by Bukit Pelali Properties Sdn Bhd (“BPSB”), a joint venture of APSB.   The purpose of the Astaka @ One Bukit Senyum Project was to construct residential towers, a five-star hotel, branded residences, serviced apartments, an entertainment hub, an office tower, and the headquarters of Johor Bahru’s City Council (Menara MBJB) in Johor Bahru within Johor State. China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on or around August 2, 2015. Then, on June 6, 2017, a topping off ceremony took place at the project site. On October 1, 2018, a Certificate of Practical Completion (""CPC"") was issued to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd to certify that construction activities were practically completed on September 19, 2018.   However, this project was plagued by controversies related to a contractual dispute. As of the June 30, 2017 loan repayment date, it had not been repaid and APSB did not make a formal request to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. for a final extension to September 30, 2017. APSB then received three letters of demand from China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. for the recovery of the outstanding debt. The first letter, received by APSB's lawyers on October 2, 2018, stated for the lawyers to 'kindly urge your clients to repay the loan with the late payment interest'. The claim amount of MYR 51.48 million (SGD 16.55 million) represented 313.5% of APSD’s cash and cash equivalents, 21.2% of its net asset value (NAV), and 213.9% of its net profit before tax. The second letter of demand, received by APSB on February 13, 2019, demanded the outstanding amount plus interest to be paid within 60 days, failing which China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd would have to commence legal proceedings for the recovery of the same. That claim amount of MYR 113.54 million represented 1,420% of APSD’s cash and cash equivalents, 47.8% of its NAV, and 838.3% of its net profit before tax. The third letter of demand, dated July 11, 2019, was sent to APSB by courier. It stated that China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd was thereby making a payment claim pursuant to and under the Construction Industry Payment and Adjudication Act. The claim amount of MYR 125.35 million represented 659.3% of the APSD’s cash and cash equivalents, 62.4% of its NAV, and 925.4% of its net profit before tax. The management confirmed that the group had not received any legal letter of demand, other than a letter from a supplier for an outstanding amount of approximately MYR 1.8 million. On September 5, 2019, APSD released an announcement on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) relating to the receipt of the letters, the need for the prior year adjustment on the under-recognition of interest expense, and the intention to appoint an independent reviewer to undertake a review of the matters that 'might have given rise to the oversight'. It then requested for a voluntary suspension of the trading of its shares, the resolution of the letters of demand, and the issues raised by the independent review to be undertaken. Trading in the company's shares have remained suspended to date. It is facing legal proceedings from one of its contractors and China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. SGX said there was no dispute that APSB was in default of the loan. It noted that amounts claimed in the letters of demand constituted a 'significant' proportion of the group's assets; repaying the loans would result in a substantial outflow of APSD’s cash, and in turn would result in a significant deterioration of its financial position and diminution in the value of its assets, and potentially affect its ability to operate. Non-disclosure of the receipt of the letters of demand had also resulted in investors and shareholders trading in the company's securities without the knowledge that there existed factors that would adversely affect the company's value and prospects. On July 22, 2019, a resolution agreement was signed by the relevant parties, which stated that the company would plead guilty to failing to promptly disclose the receipt of the third letter of demand. Astaka Holdings' executive director and former chief executive Zamani Bin Kasim was required to resign from all his current positions and not to be appointed to any position in the company for two years from August 17, 2021. Public reprimands were also issued to APSD, Mr. Zamani, and former chief financial officer of Astaka Holdings Lee Shih Yi. Since APSD had failed to pay pursuant to the loan agreement, China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. initiated adjudication proceedings against Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd by way of a payment claim dated July 11, 2019 (“the First Payment Claim”), for the unpaid sum. The parties then entered into negotiations which crystallized into a settlement agreement dated October 1, 2019 (“the Settlement Agreement”), whereby APSD had agreed to settle outstanding payments. APSD, however still failed to make payment according to the timeline stipulated in the Settlement Agreement. China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. then demanded from APSD the outstanding sums under the Settlement Agreement, to which APSD had failed to comply with. As of April 3, 2020, APSB had paid RM21,135,991.93 to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. The sum due from APSB to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. under the loan agreement was RM 74,378,046.43 As a result, China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. issued a second payment claim on November 25, 2020 (“the Second Payment Claim”) to claim for sums due under the Settlement Agreement. ","1. This project is also known as the Astaka high-rise commercial residential project. The Chinese project title is 来西亚ASTAKA高层商用住宅项目 or ASTAKA高层商用住宅项目. The Malay project title is Cadangan Pembangunan Fasa 1 – Bangunan Perdagangan 70 Tingkat. 2. According to Sinosure, it underwrote this project for amount equivalent to $103 million. Therefore, for the time being, AidData assumes that the loan from China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. However, it is possible that the August 2, 2015 commercial contract was financed with a loan from a Chinese bank. This issue merits further investigation. 3. Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd defaulted on its contractual payment obligations to China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd before it requested and secured an interest-free loan from China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd on April 12, 2017.",Completion,Commercial,Loan,Loan,0.25,OOF-like,330,TRADE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS,Yes,,China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd,State-owned Company,No,,,Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd (APSB),Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle,,,,China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd,Chinese State-owned Company,,,,Yes,China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure),Chinese State-owned Company,,,,,,,46532461.19,MYR,,12474940.2896756,10825763.4390289,46532461.19,12474940.2896756,10825763.4390289,,2017-04-12,No,,2015-08-02,,,2017-11-04,2018-09-19,,-319.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2017-04-12,2017-07-12,1.1726,1.1726,0.6049,Bilateral Loan,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,No,Yes,,No Host Government Ownership,No Chinese Government Ownership,Private debt,14,8,https://www.sinosure.com.cn/jty/ggkfsszn/fwjmqgjs/2018/11/192207.shtml|https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/astaka-unit-receives-letters-of-demand-for-rm1253m-owed-to-contractor|https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ASTAKA-HOLDINGS-LIMITED-25331332/news/Asset-Acquisitions-and-Disposals-SETTLEMENT-AGREEMENT-WITH-CHINA-STATE-CONSTRUCTION-ENGINEERING-M-37163714/|https://astaka.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021.1005.AHL_.Annc_.Update-on-Legal-Proceedings-with-CSCE.final_.pdf|https://www.dropbox.com/s/durqgnm0vhs9op9/China-State-Construction-Engineering-M-Sdn-Bhd-v-Astaka-Padu-Sdn-Bhd.pdf?dl=0|https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/Astaka%20AR18.ashx?App=Announcement&FileID=528671|https://astaka.com.my/about/|https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/astaka-unit-receives-letters-of-demand-for-413m-owed-to-contractor|https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SINGAPORE-EXCHANGE-LIMITE-6491511/news/SGX-Orders-ASTAKA-Holdings-Executive-Director-Former-CEO-to-Resign-from-All-Posts-36245004/|https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/2020.0403.AHL%20Independent%20Fact%20Finding%20Report.ashx?App=Announcement&FileID=604970|http://www.cscec8bgz.com/newsitem/277892033|https://www.163.com/dy/article/FTJED6RM0535HX8T.html|https://8bur.cscec.com/xwzx18/gskx18/201412/2834068.html|https://www.sohu.com/a/197506050_264447,"一带一路重大项目巡礼——中长期出口信用保险-sinosure|Astaka unit receives letters of demand for RM125.3m owed to contractor|Asset Acquisitions and Disposals::SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH CHINA STATE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING (M) SDN BHD|UPDATE ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH CHINA STATE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING (M) SDN BHD|Grounds of Judgment|BUILDING OUR PRESTIGE Annual Report 2018|History|Astaka unit receives letters of demand for $41.3m owed to contractor|SGX Orders ASTAKA Holdings' Executive Director, Former CEO to Resign from All Posts|Astaka Holdings Limited Independent Fact-Finding Report Strictly private & confidential|东南亚第一高住宅楼新山ASTAKA举办“封顶庆祝典礼”|275米+252米！马来西亚“ASTAKA”获境外国优奖！|中建马来西亚公司中标新山Astaka超高层公寓项目|砥砺奋进的五年|中国信保的丝路故事 ",sinosure|The Business Times|MarketScreener|Astaka Holdings Limited|High Court of Malaya|Astaka Holdings Inc.|Astaka Holdings|The Straits Time|MarketScreener|Astaka Holdings Limited|China Construction Eighth Engineering Division.Corp SouthChina Branch||China Construction Eighth Engineering Division Corp|Sohu,"Donor/Recipient Official Source|Media Report|Media Report|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source|Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient, non-Implementing)|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source|Media Report|Media Report|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source|Media Report|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source|Media Report",,,Yes,Upper middle income,"The purpose of the Astaka @ One Bukit Senyum Project was to construct residential towers, a five-star hotel, branded residences, serviced apartments, an entertainment hub, an office tower, and the headquarters of Johor Bahru’s City Council (Menara MBJB) in Johor Bahru within Johor State.

66656,Yes,2440,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2016,2017.0,,"ICBC, BoC, and CCB provide RM 3 billion syndicated overseas investment loan to facilitate acquisition of 60% equity stake in Bandar Malaysia and finance related project costs (Linked to Project ID#70527)","In June 2015, TRX City Sdn Bhd (TRXC)— a wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance — launched an international request for proposals (RP) to source investors for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd (ICSB) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn BHd (IWH) [60% ownership stake] and China Railway Engineering Corp (M) Sdn Bhd (CREC) [40% ownership stake] — was the winning bidder. On December 31, 2015, 1MDB — a Malaysia state investment fund — signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with ICSB for the sale of 60% equity in Bandar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (BMSB). As part of this agreement, ICSB paid a 10% (RM 741 million) deposit, which was channelled to 1MDB (the parent company of TRXC at the time) to help it meet its outstanding debt obligations. ICSB valued 100% of Bandar Malaysia's land at RM 12.35 billion, and by extension, 60% of its land at RM 7.41 billion.   Then, on June 16, 2016, Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and China Construction Bank (CCB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) expressing their intent in providing a loan to ICSB for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. During the same month, BOC, ICBC, and CCB signed a syndicated overseas investment loan agreement with ICSB worth RM 3 billion to facilitate its acquisition of a 60% equity stake in BMSB and finance associated project costs. The loan carried a 5-year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. ICBC served as the mandated lead arranger of the syndicated loan. On June 16, 2016, CREC also agreed to make a $2 billion investment in ICSB (captured via Project ID#70527).   However, on May 3, 2017, TRXC notified ICSB that it had failed to meet the requirements of the agreement reached on December 31, 2015 and the acquisition was being terminated. TRXC refunded the RM 741 million deposit. Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance had to step in to advance the amount to TRXC as the funds were earlier used to pay 1MDB obligations. Then, in June 2017, Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Fortune 500 companies or international real estate companies to take on the role of master developer of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. However, a qualified company was not identified.   Then, on April 25, 2019, during the second “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum, witnessed by the prime ministers of China and Malaysia, CREC President Zhang Zongyan and Malaysian Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Azmin signed a framework agreement for the ‘restoration’ of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. Two days later, on April 27, 2019, CREC announced that it would resume its participation in the acquisition of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project and maintain the original purchase price and shareholding structure. Then, on December 17, 2019, TRXC sold a 60% equity stake in BMSB to ICSB for RM 7.41 billion after the parties inked a restated shared and amended share sale agreement and shareholder agreement.  The purpose of the Bandar Malaysia project is to construct 10,000 affordable housing units on a 486-acre site and an 85-acre park for the public. The project site is located in the the heart of Kuala Lumpur at the site of Royal Malaysian Air Force base on Jalan Sg Besi. The project officially commenced on April 1, 2017. Project implementation was delayed in May 2017 due to a contractual dispute. The project was restarted in April 2019. On May 6, 2021, IWH-CREC and Malaysia's Ministry of finance jointly agreed to terminate their contract due to an inability to agree on preceding conditions for the project. The project is expected to continue but not with CREC-funding. ","1. Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo, a Malaysian businessman and investor, controls a 63% stake in IWH, while Johor state government's Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor Sdn Bhd holds the remaining 37%.2. One media source suggests that the loan agreement was signed on April 1, 2017 rather than in June 2016. For the time being, AidData has coded the commitment (loan signature) year as 2016 since one of the lenders (ICBC) claims that it reached financial close in June 2016.3. TRXC was formerly a subsidiary of 1Malaysia Development Bhd before it was transferred to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance due to mounting 1MDB debts and the inability to fund the TRXC projects, including the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. 4.

ICBC served as the mandated lead arranger of the syndicated loan. The loan carried a 1 year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. CGNPC provided a corporate guarantee in support of the loan.   On November 23, 2015, 1MDB — a Malaysian state investment fund — agreed to sell its energy business (Edra Global Energy Berhad) in a $2.3 billion cash deal to China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) in order to reduce its indebtedness and restore investor confidence. Then, on March 23, 2016, Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd (EDRA) became a subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) following the successful acquisition of Edra Global Energy Berhad’s operating companies by CGNPC and its subsidiaries for RM 9.83 billion in cash. CGN Group also assumed all the relevant gross debt and cash of these operating companies. Following the acquisition, Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd became the new holding company of these operating companies, which include Edra Solar Sdn Bhd, Edra Energy Sdn Bhd, Powertek Energy Sdn Bhd, Jimah Teknik Sdn Bhd, Jimah O&M Sdn Bhd, Mastika Lagenda Sdn Bhd and Tiara Tanah Sdn Bhd.","1. The Chinese project title is 中国广核集团收购马来西亚埃德拉公司 项目 or 中广核Edra电站项目 or 埃德拉项目. 2. Prior to its acquisition, Edra Global Energy Berhad (also known as Edra Company of Malaysia) was the power asset arm of 1 Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). The sale of IMDB's energy assets (more than RM17 billion, equity and debt assumed) was designed to significantly reduce 1MDB's debts.3. Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd — a wholly owned subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corporation, Ltd — is a company that was incorporated in Malaysia on November 5, 2015. It is an international independent power producer, controlling a diversified portfolio of quality power generation assets across a range of technologies. Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd, together with its subsidiaries and associates, have a portfolio of 13 gas-fired and coal-fired power and desalination plants in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan and United Arab Emirates with a gross installed capacity under management of 6,619 MW and an effective capacity of 5,594 MW.4. In 2015, Malaysia's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion (approximately $700 million) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) — a government-run investment fund — to his personal bank accounts. The event triggered widespread criticism among Malaysians, with many calling for Najib Razak's resignation –- including Mahathir Mohamad, one of Najib's predecessors as prime minister, who later defeated Najib in the 2018 general election and returned to power. Razak reportedly asked Low Taek Jho (commonly referred to as Jho Low) to negotiate with the Chinese Government to resolve the 1MDB crisis. Jho Low is also accused of being the mastermind of an elaborate effort to defraud 1MDB. In October 2016, Interpol published a red notice at Singapore's request to locate and arrest Low in an investigation related to 1MDB scandal. Then, in November 2020, Al-Jazeera reported that Low was currently living in Macau, in a house owned by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party.

Subsequent financial statements from Kibing Group indicate that the CDB loan was approved and Kibing Group issued a corporate guarantee in support of the CDB loan. However, it is unclear if the Bank of China loan was approved. United Overseas Bank may have also issued an RMB 24 million loan to Kibing Group (M) Sdn Bhd in support of the project. The first glass production line was put into operation on March 20, 2017 and the second glass production line was put into operation in June 2017. The CDB loan commitment is captured via Project ID#62461 and the Bank of China loan is captured (as a pledge) via Project ID#62383","1: The Chinese project title is LOW-E在线镀膜和高档多元化玻璃生产线的.2: The official commitment (CDB loan agreement) date is unknown. For the time being, AidData has set the commitment year to the year in which the CDB loan application was submitted (2015).  3: Financial reporting by Kibing Group suggests that CDB may have ultimately issued two separate loans for this project (collectively worth RMB 800 million): a $70 million loan and an RMB 320 million.

China Development Bank issue a $170 million loan (captured in Project ID#49402). Then, In 2015, China Construction Bank’s Xiamen Branch, China Construction Bank’s Singapore Branch, and Xiamen University Malaysia Campus signed a trilateral agreement for China Construction Bank Singapore Branch to provide a $50 million loan (captured in Project ID#73439) — guaranteed by China Construction Bank’s Xiamen branch — in support of the Xiamen University Malaysia Campus Construction Project. $20 million of the China Construction Bank loan was reportedly disbursed shortly after the signing of the agreement. China Eximbank’s Sichuan Branch also issued a loan in support of the project (as captured via Project ID#71700); however, the face value of the loan is unknown. The total estimated cost of the Xiamen University Malaysia Campus Construction Project was RMB 1.6 billion ($315 million).  The purpose of this project was to construct an overseas campus of Xiamen University in Sunsuria City within the vicinity of Bandar Kota Warisan in Malaysia's Selangor State. The campus occupies 150 acres — with a total floor space of 470,000 square meters — and it includes instructional facilities, dormitories, a restaurant, a student activity center, and parking lots.  Sinohydro Bureau 7 Co. Ltd. was the contractor responsible for implementation and it undertook the project in three phases. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. However, construction did not begin until October 17, 2014. Phase 1 was completed on September 30, 2015 and two major buildings were completed in October 2015 (with a Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC) issued during the same month). Phase 2 was completed on July 31, 2016. Phase 3 was completed on September 1, 2016. XMUM welcomed its first class of students to campus on February 22, 2016.

This agreement paved the way for a ‘breeding loan’ for a pair of giant pandas from China to Malaysia. The breeding loan agreement signing was witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and a Member of the Permanent Committee of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Central Political Bureau Committee, He Guaqiang. The two giant pandas, which were to be loaned for 10 years, were described as a symbol of the 40th anniversary of Malaysia-China diplomatic relations, to be celebrated in 2014. Malaysia received the pandas in May 2014 and they were to reside in Kuala Lumpur's Zoo Negara. Based on the news release from the Malaysiakini, due to the budget consideration and in line with the requirements of the agreement (revision every three years), it is uncertain whether to continue to keep the giant pandas with the second cub. However, the two pandas are still in Malaysia in 2018 according to the news.   ","A breeding loan is a type of barter transaction.

(also known as Kibing Group or 株洲旗滨集团股份有限公司) — a large enterprise group in China that mainly produces high-end glass products such as high-quality float glass, energy-saving glass, solar glass and ultra-thin glass, with production bases in Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces — announced plans to construct a new float line (glass factory) in Malaysia. It established a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary called Kibing Group (M) Sdn Bhd [also known as Kibing Group (Malaysia) Co., Ltd. or 旗滨集团（马来西亚）有限公司] for this purpose on October 23, 2014. Then, on May 16, 2015, Kibing Group disclosed that it would invest RMB 1.175 billion in the construction of a glass factory — with two production lines and the capacity to produce 1400 tons per day of clear float glass 3~19mm thick — in the city of Seremban within the district of Seremban and the state of Negeri Sembilan.   In November 2015, Kibing Group applied for two loans on behalf of Kibing Group (M) Sdn Bhd: an RMB 800 million loan with a two year maturity from the Fujian Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) and a $6.5 million (approximately RM 24 million) loan with a one year maturity from Bank Of China (Malaysia) Berhad. Subsequent financial statements from Kibing Group indicate that the CDB loan was approved and Kibing Group issued a corporate guarantee in support of the CDB loan. However, it is unclear if the Bank of China loan was approved. United Overseas Bank may have also issued an RMB 24 million loan to Kibing Group (M) Sdn Bhd in support of the project. The first glass production line was put into operation on March 20, 2017 and the second glass production line was put into operation in June 2017.

65990,Yes,,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2012,2011.0,2016.0,CDB provides $175 million loan for Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant Construction Project,"In late 2009, Beijing Enterprises Water Group Limited (BEWGL) entered into a Memorandum of Water Cooperation with the Malaysian Government. Under the terms of the Memorandum BEWGL agreed in principle to invest RMB 12 billion in the construction of 19 sewage treatment plants, supporting pipe networks and auxiliary facilities in Malaysia. On July 4, 2011, BEWGL received the approval from Malaysia's Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water to construct the Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant in the city of Kuala Lumpur. Then, on November 3, 2011, BEWG (M) Sdn Bhd (BEWGM) — a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing Enterprises Water Group Limited (BEWG) that was locally incorporated in Malaysia in January 2010 — signed a contract with the Malaysian Government to construct the Pantai 2 sewage treatment plant. The total value of the contract was approximately RM 980 million (or RMB 2.1 billion).   Several months later, in March 2012, China Development Bank’s Hong Kong Branch issued a loan worth $175 million to BEWGM for the Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant Construction Project. The loan carried a five-year maturity but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The borrower pledged a formal security interest (including future revenue to be generated by the sewage treatment plant) to the lender. BEWGL also issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the CDB loan to finance the 2011 commercial contract with the Government of Malaysia.  The purpose of the project was to construct a sewage treatment plant in the city of Kuala Lumpur to serve the Pantai catchment area, which covers 6,700 hectares in the central and south-western parts of the city—including Bandar Baru Sentul, Sentul Raya, the Bukit Kiara central business district, Taman Botani and parts of Petaling Jaya. The plant was designed with a treatment capacity of 320,000 tons/day and it was meant to serve a population of 1.43 million. The main unit of the sewage treatment plant was to be built underground, with only the sludge digestion and administrative building built above ground. The project also involved the construction of a large-scale multi-functional sports leisure landscape park above the underground sewage plant. The Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant is the third largest underground sewage plant in the world.   BEWGM was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Its EPC contract specified a 4 year period of construction and a 2 year period of operations and maintenance. The date of project site possession was July 28, 2011. The project was officially accepted by the local authorities on June 30, 2016. At that point, the Pantai 2 sewage treatment plant had already been successfully running for 11 months. An official project handover ceremony took place on May 25, 2017.","1. One source suggests that CDB provides a loan worth RMB 2.3 billion loan rather than $175 million in support of the Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant Construction Project. This issue requires further investigation. 2. This project is also known as the Kuala Lumpur Pantai 2 Sewage Treatment Plant Project, the Pandai II Sewage Treatment Plant Project, and the Pantai No.2 Sewage Treatment Plant Project.

62385,No,2253,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2009,,,CDB pledges $16.67 million loan for Rubber Forest Plantation Project (Linked to Project ID#70518 and ID#73574),"In 2005, Sabah State Government granted Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd a 100-year sustainable forest management license for a 100,000 hectare rubber forest. Then, on September 13, 2008, Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd and Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group (also known as 广东省农垦集团公司 or 广东农垦) signed a 50-year, joint venture agreement for the Rubber Forest Plantation Project. The special purpose vehicle that they established is called Bornion Guangken Rubber Sdn Bhd [BGR or 广垦橡胶（沙捞越）有限公司] and it is 50% owned by Bornion Timber and 50% owned by Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group. Then, in late 2009, Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group applied for two loans on behalf of BGR to support the $71.44 million Rubber Forest Plantation Project: a $16.67 million loan from the Guangdong Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) and a loan (with an unknown face value) from China Eximbank. In late 2009, the China Eximbank loan was approved. Then, in Q1 of 2010, $1.5 million was disbursed through the China Eximbank loan. Project ID#73574 captures the China Eximbank loan and Project ID#62385 captures the CDB loan (as a pledge). Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group also invested $9.05 million of its own funding to cover 50% of the total project cost (as captured in via Project ID#70518).  The purpose of the project was to construct and operate a 30,000 hectare rubber forest plantation in the Ulu Milan Forest Reserve (Forest Management Unit 11 or FMU11) near the village of Kg Alab Lanas within Keningau District and Sabah State. The project involved the acquisition of agricultural equipment, the planting of rubber trees, and the installation of production facilities and supporting infrastructure. The project was originally expected to be implemented between 2009 and 2021. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 6, 2009. Then on November 14, 2009, a trial production ceremony was held. BGR recruited more than 1,000 employees to work on the rubber plantation, of which over 90 percent were local hires. However, this project encountered local resistance to implementation. On January 4, 2012, 50 villagers marched into the FMU11 licensed area of Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd (BTSB) and set fire to the workers’ dwellings. The villagers claimed that BTSB had encroached on Native Customary Rights (NCR) land. Then, on January 5, 2012, the villagers lodged a report, accusing BTSB of bulldozing their ancestral burial grounds. They claimed that more than 10,000 acres around the village had been invaded by BTSB, which included rubber plantations, vegetable, rice and other crops. They also claimed that 638 people in the village feared that their native land would be confiscated. BGR reportedly planted more than four million rubber trees in FMU11 between 2009 and 2016. Then, on August 23, 2016, the plantation was officially opened and a rubber tapping ceremony took place.

66615,Yes,1638,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2009,2008.0,2013.0,China Eximbank provides $330 million preferential buyer's credit for Second Penang Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#34958),"In 2006, the Government of Malaysia selected UEM Group Berhad — a wholly owned subsidiary of Khazanah Nasional Bhd — as the concessionaire responsible for building, managing, operating and maintaining the second Penang bridge. Then, on July 13, 2007, a joint venture called the CHEC-UEMC Consortium was formed by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (51% ownership stake) and UEMC (49% ownership stake) to implement the Penang Second Crossing Bridge Construction Project. UEMC is a subsidiary of UEM Group. On the same day, China Eximbank and Bank Pembangunan — a state-owned development bank in Malaysia — signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) regarding a $800 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project (captured via Project ID #34958). The specified borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 20 year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract with the CHEC-UEMC Consortium. However, UEM and CHEC could not arrive at a shareholders agreement in July 2008 due to disagreements over the apportionment of jobs and costs. Then, on August 29, 2008, the Malaysian Government terminated its concession agreement with UEM Group Berhad. Jambatan Kedua Sdn Bhd (JKSB) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned company of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) -- was subsequently appointed as the concessionaire responsible for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project.   In 2009, China Eximbank and JKSB signed a $330 million PBC agreement for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project. Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan (PBC). China Eximbank waived the requirement that the borrower purchase buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower made repayments worth $11 million in 2016 and $22 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $297 million. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was approximately $288 million (RM 1.2 billion).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 24 km (15 mi) dual carriageway toll bridge that connects Bandar Cassia (Batu Kawan) in Seberang Perai on mainland Peninsular Malaysia with Batu Maung on Penang Island. The bridge consists of precast segmental concrete marine viaducts in 55-meter (180-feet) span modules and a cast in-situ concrete cable-stayed bridge measuring 475 meters (1,558 feet). It is the second bridge to link the island to the mainland after the first Penang Bridge. It extends over 16.9 km (10.5 mi) of water, making it the longest bridge in Malaysia and the second longest in Southeast Asia.   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) and UEM Builders were the main contractors responsible for implementation. Construction began on November 8, 2008 and the originally scheduled project completion date was November 8, 2013. As of December 2009, the project had achieved an 8.65% completion rate. It was 24% complete as of April 2010. On January 27, 2011, the construction of the main bridge pile foundation was completed. The project was 60.87% complete as of March 2012. The capping of the main tower took place on August 7, 2012. As of October 3, 2012, the project was 84% complete. The final closure of the cable stayed bridge at the main navigational span of the Penang Second Bridge was completed on April 20, 2013. Then, on April 30, 2013, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak became the country’s first leader to use the Penang Second Bridge to cross from the island to the mainland to attend a function in Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai. Penang Second Bridge was officially completed and accepted by the project owner (JKSB) on September 15, 2013. It was opened to the traffic at 12.01 AM on March 2, 2014 and renamed the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge. It was named after Tuanku Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah, the Sultan of Kedah and the reigning Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.","1.

73574,Yes,2253,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2009,2009.0,2016.0,China Eximbank provides loan for Rubber Forest Plantation Project (Linked to Project ID#62385 and #70518),"In 2005, Sabah State Government granted Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd a 100-year sustainable forest management license for a 100,000 hectare rubber forest. Then, on September 13, 2008, Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd and Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group (also known as 广东省农垦集团公司 or 广东农垦) signed a 50-year, joint venture agreement for the Rubber Forest Plantation Project. The special purpose vehicle that they established is called Bornion Guangken Rubber Sdn Bhd [BGR or 广垦橡胶（沙捞越）有限公司] and it is 50% owned by Bornion Timber and 50% owned by Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group. Then, in late 2009, Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group applied for two loans on behalf of BGR to support the $71.44 million Rubber Forest Plantation Project: a $16.67 million loan from the Guangdong Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) and a loan (with an unknown face value) from the Export-Import Bank of China. In late 2009, the China Eximbank loan was approved. Then, in Q1 of 2010, $1.5 million was disbursed through the China Eximbank loan. Project ID#73574 captures the China Eximbank loan and Project ID#62385 captures the CDB loan (as a pledge). Guangdong Guangken Rubber Group also invested $9.05 million of its own funding to cover 50% of the total project cost (as captured in via Project ID#70518).  The purpose of the project was to construct and operate a 30,000 hectare rubber forest plantation in the Ulu Milan Forest Reserve (Forest Management Unit 11 or FMU11) near the village of Kg Alab Lanas within Keningau District and Sabah State. The project involved the acquisition of agricultural equipment, the planting of rubber trees, and the installation of production facilities and supporting infrastructure. The project was originally expected to be implemented between 2009 and 2021. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 6, 2009. Then on November 14, 2009, a trial production ceremony was held. BGR recruited more than 1,000 employees to work on the rubber plantation, of which over 90 percent were local hires. However, this project encountered local resistance to implementation. On January 4, 2012, 50 villagers marched into the FMU11 licensed area of Bornion Timber Sdn Bhd (BTSB) and set fire to the workers’ dwellings. The villagers claimed that BTSB had encroached on Native Customary Rights (NCR) land. Then, on January 5, 2012, the villagers lodged a report, accusing BTSB of bulldozing their ancestral burial grounds. They claimed that more than 10,000 acres around the village had been invaded by BTSB, which included rubber plantations, vegetable, rice and other crops. They also claimed that 638 people in the village feared that their native land would be confiscated. BGR reportedly planted more than four million rubber trees in FMU11 between 2009 and 2016.

34958,No,1638,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2007,2008.0,2014.0,China Eximbank pledges $800 million preferential buyer's credit for Second Penang Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#66615),"In 2006, the Government of Malaysia selected UEM Group Berhad — a wholly owned subsidiary of Khazanah Nasional Bhd — as the concessionaire responsible for building, managing, operating and maintaining the second Penang bridge. Then, on July 13, 2007, a joint venture called the CHEC-UEMC Consortium was formed by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (51% ownership stake) and UEMC (49% ownership stake) to implement the Penang Second Crossing Bridge Construction Project. UEMC is a subsidiary of UEM Group. On the same day, China Eximbank and Bank Pembangunan — a state-owned development bank in Malaysia — signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) regarding a $800 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project. The specified borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 20 year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used to partially finance an EPC contract with the CHEC-UEMC Consortium. However, UEM and CHEC could not arrive at a shareholders agreement in July 2008 due to disagreements over the apportionment of jobs and costs. Then, on August 29, 2008, the Malaysian Government terminated its concession agreement with UEM Group Berhad.   Jambatan Kedua Sdn Bhd (JKSB) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned company of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) -- was subsequently appointed as the concessionaire responsible for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project. In 2009, China Eximbank and JKSB signed a $330 million PBC agreement for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project (captured in #66615). Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. China Eximbank waived the requirement that the borrower purchase buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 24 km (15 mi) dual carriageway toll bridge that connects Bandar Cassia (Batu Kawan) in Seberang Perai on mainland Peninsular Malaysia with Batu Maung on Penang Island. The bridge consists of precast segmental concrete marine viaducts in 55-meter (180-feet) span modules and a cast in-situ concrete cable-stayed bridge measuring 475 meters (1,558 feet). It is the second bridge to link the island to the mainland after the first Penang Bridge. It extends over 16.9 km (10.5 mi) of water, making it the longest bridge in Malaysia and the second longest in Southeast Asia.   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) and UEM Builders were the main contractors responsible for implementation. Construction began on November 8, 2008 and the originally scheduled project completion date was November 8, 2013. As of December 2009, the project had achieved an 8.65% completion rate. It was 24% complete as of April 2010. On January 27, 2011, the construction of the main bridge pile foundation was completed. The project was 60.87% complete as of March 2012. The capping of the main tower took place on August 7, 2012. As of October 3, 2012, the project was 84% complete. The final closure of the cable stayed bridge at the main navigational span of the Penang Second Bridge was completed on April 20, 2013. Then, on April 30, 2013, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak became the country’s first leader to use the Penang Second Bridge to cross from the island to the mainland to attend a function in Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai. Penang Second Bridge was officially completed and accepted by the project owner (JKSB) on September 15, 2013. It was opened to the traffic at 12.01 AM on March 2, 2014 and renamed the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge. It was named after Tuanku Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah, the Sultan of Kedah and the reigning Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. ","This project is also known as the Second Penang Bridge Project, the E28 Bridge Construction Project, and the Penang Second Crossing Bridge Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 马来西亚槟城二桥工程 or 马来西亚槟城二桥（第二跨海大桥) or 马来西亚槟城二桥项目 or 马来西亚槟城二桥项目. The Malay project title is Jambatan Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah or Jambatan Kedua Pulau Pinang. The China Eximbank loan that supported this project is not included in the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. The $800 million PBC pledge in 2007 is captured in Project ID#34958. The $330 million PBC commitment in 2009 is captured in Project ID#66615.

Following the feasibility study, CMS and its consortium partners, which included the State Grid Corporation of China, subsequently submitted a proposal to the Government of Malaysia to set-up and operate the aluminum smelter at a cost of between RM 9 billion and RM 11 billion. Then, in December 2005, China Eximbank agreed in principle to provide a 10-year soft loan to finance the cost of building the aluminum smelter proposed by the Chinese-Malaysian consortium. The smelter was to be constructed by Shandong Luneng Group Co Ltd. The aluminum smelter was expected to cost $3.2 billion. The Chinese companies in the consortium were expected take up a 50% ownership stake in the project, with the remaining equity to be held by the Malaysian companies in the consortium. The China Eximbank loan was expected to carry a 10-year maturity and an interest rate of 2-3%. However, AidData has not identified any evidence that a loan agreement with China Eximbank was ever finalized. ","1: This project is also known as the Shandong Luneng Aluminum Smelter Plant Project. 2: On February 9, 2010, Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (CHALCO) entered into a framework agreement with GIIG Holding Sdn Bhd ('GIIG') to develop, own and operate a primary aluminum plant in Samalaju Industrial Part in Bintulu, Sarawak with an annual capacity of approximately 330,000 tons. Smelter Asia Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GIIG was to be reorganized as a joint venture to oversee the development and operation of the primary aluminum plant project. The total investment of this project was estimated to be $1.0 billion, and CHALCO planned to contribute between $350 million to $400 million for 35% to 40% of the equity interest in the joint venture. However, it is unclear if this was the reason that the Shandong Luneng Aluminum Smelter Plant Project did not move forward.”",Pipeline: Pledge,Commercial,Loan,Loan,0.25,OOF-like,320,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Yes,,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),State-owned Policy Bank,No,,,Government of Malaysia,Recipient Government Agency,,,,Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd.|Press Metal Sdn.

This term loan facility carried a maturity period of three years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 18 basis points. Formal signing was scheduled on February 14, 2005 as allocations were being finalized, and the loan was successfully entered into.  BOC contributed $50 million USD on a take-and-hold basis. In addition to BOC, the following lenders contributed to the loan syndicate, with their contributions (if known): Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Mizuho Corporate Bank (MHCB), Bayerische Landesbank (BayernLB) ($75 million USD), Calyon )($75 million USD), HSH Nordbank AG ($75 million USD), UFJ Bank ($75 million USD), Fortis Bank ($50 million USD), Dresdner Bank ($10 million USD), and DZ Bank ($10 million USD. Barclays Capital, Citigroup, and MHCB served as the mandated lead arrangers; the other lenders joined in sub-underwriting, which saw the loan oversubscribed and increased from its initial $400 million USD target and general syndication to not be launched.","1. As 'Maybank Annual Report 2005' confirms the loan was successfully entered into and 'Malaysia', made when all the lenders had joined, states that signing was planned for two weeks from then, on February 14, 2005, AidData has assumed the loan was successfully signed on that date.2. A 6-month LIBOR was assumed. The average 6-month LIBOR for February 2005 was 2.891%.
